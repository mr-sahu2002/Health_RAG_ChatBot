Beauty products -- everything from shampoo to [makeup](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cm/rm-quiz-makeup) to cologne -- can help you feel on top of your game. They can also cause irritated [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin) or an [allergic reaction](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergic-reaction-causes). A dermatology study published in 2010 found that more than a third of over 900 study participants had at least one allergic reaction to cosmetic ingredients.

Problems can range from simple [rashes](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/rash-age-12-and-older-topic-overview) to full-blown allergic reactions. Symptoms can start right after you use something new -- or after years of using a product with no problems.

There are two types of skin reactions to [beauty](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/default.htm) products. One, called irritant contact [dermatitis](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/contact-dermatitis), happens when something actually damages your skin. Your skin might burn, sting, itch, or get red right where you used the product. You might get [blisters](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blisters-basics) and have oozing, especially if you scratch.

The other kind of reaction actually involves your immune system. It’s called allergic contact [dermatitis](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-common-adult-skin-problems) and symptoms can include redness, swelling, [itching](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-pruritus), and [hives](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/skin-conditions-hives-urticaria-angioedema). Your skin can get red and raw. You can get an [allergic reaction](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergic-reaction-causes) on any part of your body, although it happens most often on the face, lips, [eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes), ears, and neck.

It can be hard to tell the two types of reactions apart. You can even have a reaction that’s a combination of the two.

Fragrances and preservatives are often to blame. Even products that say they are "unscented" can have a fragrance used to cover up chemical scents. You may not smell it, but it's there, and may cause an [allergic reaction](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/tc/allergic-reaction-topic-overview).

To be sure there's no perfume, look for products marked "fragrance-free" or "without perfume."

Almost any product that has water must have some preservatives. The most common are parabens, imidazolidinyl urea, Quaternium-15, DMDM hydantoin, phenoxyethanol, methylchloroisothiazolinone, and [formaldehyde](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-9987/formaldehyde+topical/details). All have been linked to skin allergies.

## Beauty Products to Watch for

The beauty products most likely to cause skin reactions include bath soaps, detergents, antiperspirants, [eye makeup](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/ss/slideshow-beautiful-eye-secrets), moisturizers, shampoos, long-wearing lip stains, nail polish (especially those that have formaldehyde), and fingernail glue containing methacrylate.

[Hair](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics) dyes can also cause skin reactions, especially those containing p-phenylenediamine as well as ammonium persulfate used to lighten [hair](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cm/rm-quiz-hair-care).

Beauty products that have alpha-hydroxy acids can cause problems for some people, like redness, swelling, blisters, and [itching](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/cm/rm-itch-quiz) \-\- especially with products that have an AHA level over 10%.

Retin-A wrinkle creams and serums can also cause irritant contact dermatitis in some people.

Many people have " [sunscreen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-366/sunscreen+topical/details) sensitivity." For them, almost all sun-protection products can cause a dermatitis-type reaction. If this is the case for you, talk to a dermatologist about how to best protect your skin from the sun.

## Treatments for Skin Reactions

The most important thing is to stop using whatever’s causing the reaction right away. This may be enough to fix the problem. Some [hydrocortisone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-148380/anti-itch+(hydrocortisone)+topical/details) preparations  may cause side effects for sensitive areas like your face, so first check with your doctor before using it.

## How to Avoid Skin Reactions to Beauty Products

- Look for products with the fewest ingredients. This will lower your chance of a reaction.
- Do a patch test before using any product. Place a small amount on the inside of your elbow and wait 48 hours to 72 hours. If you have redness, swelling, itching, or burning, don't use that product.
- Always apply fragrance to your clothes, not your skin. This can help reduce the risk of reaction to the fragrance. It can also reduce the risk of the fragrance interacting with ingredients in other products and causing a skin reaction.
- Just because a label says something is "hypoallergenic," "dermatologist tested," "sensitivity tested," or "non-irritating," that's no guarantee that the products will be kind to your skin. Some companies do the testing, others don't. There are no rules about how these terms can be used on a label.

Most of the time, you won't know the exact day you got pregnant. Your doctor will count the start of your pregnancy from the first day of your last menstrual period. That's about 2 weeks ahead of when conception happens.

Here's a primer on conception:

[**Ovulation**](https://www.webmd.com/baby/ss/slideshow-understanding-fertility-ovulation)

Each month inside your ovaries, a group of eggs starts to grow in small, fluid-filled sacs called follicles. Eventually, one of the eggs erupts from the follicle (ovulation). It usually happens about 2 weeks before your next period.

**Hormones rise**

After the egg leaves the follicle, the follicle develops into something called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum releases a hormone that helps thicken the lining of your uterus, getting it ready for the egg.

**The egg travels to the fallopian tube**

After the egg is released, it moves into the fallopian tube. It stays there for about 24 hours, waiting for a single [sperm](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/sperm-and-semen-faq) to fertilize it. All this happens, on average, about 2 weeks before your next period.

**If the egg isn't fertilized**

If no sperm is around to fertilize the egg, it moves through to the uterus and disintegrates. Your hormone levels go back to normal. Your body sheds the thick lining of the uterus, and your period starts.

**Fertilization**

If one sperm does make its way into the fallopian tube and burrows into the egg, it fertilizes the egg. The egg changes so that no other sperm can get in.

At the instant of fertilization, your baby's genes and sex are set. If the sperm has a Y chromosome, your baby will be a boy. If it has an X chromosome, the baby will be a girl.

**Implantation: Moving to the uterus**

The fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tube for about 3 to 4 days. But within 24 hours of being fertilized, it starts dividing fast into many cells. It keeps dividing as it moves slowly through the fallopian tube to the uterus. Its next job is to attach to the lining of the uterus. This is called implantation.

You might notice spotting (slight bleeding) for 1 or 2 days around the time of implantation. The lining of the uterus gets thicker and the cervix is sealed by a plug of mucus. It will stay in place until the baby is ready to be born.

Within 3 weeks, the cells begin to grow as clumps, and the baby's first nerve cells have already formed.

**Pregnancy hormones**

A pregnancy hormone known as hCG is in your blood from the time of implantation. This is the hormone detected in a [pregnancy test](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-tests). Some home pregnancy tests can detect hCG as soon as 7 days after ovulation.

## What Is Swaddling?

Swaddling is an ancient practice of wrapping up a baby to help them sleep. It's been gaining popularity over recent years, with an estimated 90% of babies in North America being swaddled in their first few months.

Swaddling recreates the cozy feeling of the womb and can help soothe an infant. Safety, however, is a concern with swaddling because of hip problems or suffocation that can happen when swaddling is not done correctly. So it's important to learn how to do it properly, as well as to know the benefits and risks of swaddling.

Swaddling your newborn can calm them down and help them sleep better and in the right position, on their back. Doctors recommend this sleeping position in babies to lower their risk of [sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/what-is-sids). Eventually, your baby will outgrow the swaddle. Here's what you need to know.

**Is swaddling safe?**

Swaddling can be safe when done correctly. It can help babies sleep better and may be especially helpful with babies born with brain conditions, colic, or an alcohol addiction. It's important to remember that babies don't have to be swaddled, but if they are, loose blankets should be avoided. And if the baby is swaddled for longer times during the day or night, a sleep sack that lets their legs move should be used vs. a fitted blanket.

## What Are Swaddling Cloths?

You can buy swaddling cloths from most baby stores. There are different types of swaddling cloths. Some of them are simple square or rectangular blankets. Others are sack-like and allow you to zip your baby inside. Some have additional flaps on the side that wrap across your baby's body and are secured with sticky strips.

**What is a swaddling bag?**

A swaddling bag is like a wearable blanket or sleeping bag that can be worn by your baby once they are able to roll over and have grown out of the swaddling stage. Swaddling bags allow your baby to have their arms free and more control of movements. They are worn over clothing or pajamas and can provide comfort without the suffocation risk of loose blankets.

## When to Swaddle Your Baby

You'll most often swaddle your [baby](https://www.webmd.com/baby/how-to-train-your-baby-to-sleep-in) before they sleep and to help calm them when they're fussy. It's important to stop swaddling once your baby starts trying to roll over. This can be as early as 2 months of age. Sleep sacks or wearable blankets that don't compress your baby's arms and chest can be worn up to about the age of 2 or about 30 lbs. Once your baby outgrows a sleeping sack, they should be able to use a blanket.

## How to Swaddle Your Baby

Follow these simple steps to swaddle your baby safely:

1. Spread your [swaddle blanket](https://www.webmd.com/baby/when-can-a-baby-sleep-with-blankets) out and fold one corner down.
2. Place your baby lying face-up on the blanket, with their head at the edge of the folded corner.
3. With one hand on your baby, pick up the left corner of the blanket. Bring the blanket across your baby's body. Tuck the blanket between their right arm and their body. It should go under their lower back and bottom.
4. Gently straighten your baby's left arm so it's against their side. Pick up the right corner of the blanket and bring it across their body. Tuck it under their left side.
5. Fold or loosely twist the bottom corner of the blanket and tuck it under your baby.
6. The swaddle should only expose your baby's head and neck.
7. Don't swaddle so tightly that your baby can't bend their legs.
8. Place your baby on their back to sleep, not on their side or stomach.

## When to Stop Swaddling

‌You should stop swaddling your baby when they start to [roll over](https://www.webmd.com/baby/when-does-a-baby-start-to-roll-over). That's typically between 2 and 4 months. During this time, your baby might be able to roll onto their tummy but not be able to roll back over. This can raise their risk of SIDS.

## Stopping Swaddling

When it's time to stop swaddling your baby and change their sleep routine, you'll need to transition them. Some babies may be used to sleeping in a swaddle. Taking them out of it might upset them and cause them to cry more during bedtime.

Create a brief transition to help them adjust to their new sleeping method. When they're showing signs of rolling over, you should take the swaddle away. You can replace the full swaddle with a wrap that meets your [baby's developmental stage](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/baby-development-1-year-old). Be sure to keep their arms free while they're sleeping.

You can still wrap your child with the same method you used for swaddling. Just keep their arms out. You can also use a sleep sack  as a helpful tool during the transition.

In a sleep sack, your baby can move around a little. This is different from no mobility with their swaddle. Getting to move around and build their strength is good for their growth. But if they roll over in the night, place them back on their back. Using a sleep sack is also helpful for getting your baby ready to sleep with a blanket when it's safe.

Once your child is done with the sleep sack, you can transition them to a wearable blanket. This will get them closer to sleeping with a blanket when they're older. A wearable blanket lets them move their arms and legs freely without hazards.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Swaddling

Swaddling can help a baby sleep but has both pros and cons. The advantages of swaddling your baby include:

- **Better sleep.** For babies, being swaddled is like being back in the womb. Some parents note that their baby is able to sleep more deeply with less startle reflex. A small study of 16 babies aged 10-16 weeks found that swaddling increases the amount of time they stay asleep and lowers the number of times they startle and wake by themselves, but more research is needed.
- **Less crying.** Research has shown that when paired with sound and movement, swaddling can help babies cry less. A study on 368 babies who cried excessively found that babies under 7 weeks old cried slightly less after being swaddled.
- **Premature babies.** Swaddling has been found to help [premature babies](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/premature-babies-complications-care) with improved development of nerves and muscles and better organization of motor movement.
- **Sleep position.** Parents who swaddle their babies are more likely to place them flat on their back when swaddled, which is the recommended sleep position for babies. **‌**

Disadvantages include:

- **Increased risk of SIDS.** There are about 3,500 baby sleep-related deaths a year in the U.S. Placing babies on their stomach to sleep is considered to be one of the most significant risk factors for SIDS, the sudden and unexplained death of a baby under the age of 1. Swaddling further increases this risk. Some researchers believe that SIDS can be caused by low arousal while an infant is sleeping, which means it's harder for them to wake up. Swaddling a baby may lower their arousal.
- **Loose bedding.** If your swaddle isn't properly done, your baby can wriggle out. This means that the swaddling cloth is left loose in the crib, which can block your baby's airway. Loose bedding increases the risk of SIDS.
- **Overheating.** As the swaddle is an extra layer, you should make sure your baby doesn't overheat. Touch their chest or back of the neck to see if they feel sweaty or warm. Remove a layer of clothing or switch to a lighter, more breathable swaddle material such as muslin or cotton.
- **Developmental dysplasia of the hip.** Improper swaddling can increase the risk of [hip dysplasia](https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-hip-dysplasia). This is a problem with the way the hip joint forms. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint. In developmental dysplasia of the hip, the ball of the hip isn't centered in the socket and, in some cases, may slide in and out of it. Studies show a connection between tight swaddling and hip dysplasia. For natural development of the hips, your baby's legs have to be able to move up and out at the hips.

## Dangers of Continued Swaddling

There has been much debate around the positives and negatives of swaddling. Ultimately, it is up to you and your family if you choose to swaddle your [newborn](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/newborn-day-in-the-life).

Ignoring the signs of your baby trying to roll over can be dangerous if you continue to swaddle them. If your baby is fussy and moving more, they can overheat while swaddled. Signs of being overheated include:

- Sweating
- Damp hair
- Flushed cheeks
- Heat rash
- Rapid breathing

After 2 months, you should reevaluate your baby’s sleeping situation. Stop swaddling if someone is watching your child for you or they're moving around. Swaddling can be dangerous for babies at any month if it's not done the right way. Because of this, some child care centers refuse to swaddle babies. Some doctors suggest it could be dangerous for children to be swaddled after 2 months.

Another danger of continued swaddling is the [increased risk of SIDS.](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/sids-prevention#1) Following safe swaddle practices can reduce these risks.

If you have any questions about whether or how to safely swaddle your baby or transition them out of their swaddle, your doctor can help. Together, you'll decide the best course of action.

## What Is the Alkaline Diet?

The alkaline diet encourages you to eat foods that are alkaline (or basic, meaning they have a pH greater than 7), instead of those that are acidic. The theory is that foods that make your body produce acid are harmful.

Celebrities like Victoria Beckman and Tom Brady helped make the diet popular. But the supposed science of the alkaline diet dates back many years.

**What is pH?**

The acid level in your body is known as pH. The premise of the alkaline diet is that if you eat certain foods, you can change your pH level. But this claim is unproven.

Scientists measure pH levels on a scale of 0-14:

- A pH of 0-6 is acidic.
- A pH of 7 is neutral.
- A pH of 8 or higher is basic, or alkaline.

**Alkaline vs. acidic foods**

Alkaline foods have a high pH level, while acidic foods have a lower pH. Some examples of alkaline foods are non-starchy veggies, fruits, nuts such as chestnuts or pumpkin seeds, and legumes like kidney beans or white beans. Acidic foods include meat, cheese, eggs, and grains. Milk and natural fats are considered neutral.

## How Does the Alkaline Diet Work?

Celebrities and book authors are the primary promoters of the alkaline diet. The diet gained popularity when Victoria Beckham tweeted about an alkaline diet cookbook in January 2013.

But many of the diet’s so-called benefits aren’t backed by scientific evidence. Everyone responds differently to different diets, so you should always talk to your doctor before starting a new eating plan.

With that said, the alkaline diet is a pitch Hollywood celebs love. Supposedly, the diet can help you lose weight and avoid problems like arthritis and cancer.

According to the "science" behind this diet, eating specific foods that make your body more alkaline can protect against those conditions as well as shed pounds.

The alkaline diet generally includes foods that are nutritious and unprocessed. People who follow this diet sometimes use a special dipstick to measure the pH in their urine. But this test is only a measurement of the pH of your pee, not your entire body.

## Alkaline Diet Menu

Most fruits and vegetables, soybean, tofu, and some nuts, seeds, and legumes are alkaline-promoting foods, so they're fair game.

Dairy, eggs, meat, most grains, and processed foods like canned and packaged snacks and convenience foods fall on the acidic side and are not allowed.

Most books that tout the alkaline diet say you shouldn't have alcohol or [caffeine](https://www.webmd.com/balance/caffeine-myths-and-facts), either.

Foods like natural fats, milk, and sugars are considered “neutral.” Advocates of the diet typically recommend that you avoid or limit neutral foods.

**Alkaline diet foods**

Some examples of alkaline foods are:

- Fruits, such as apples, cherries, pineapple, avocado, bananas, apricots, and cantaloupe
- Non-starchy vegetables, such as broccoli, beets, asparagus, leafy greens, garlic, carrots, and cabbage
- Unsweetened fruit juices
- Mineral water and herbal teas
- Nuts and seeds, such as chestnuts, pine nuts, and pumpkin seeds
- Fermented tofu or tempeh
- Some grains, such as quinoa

## Benefits of the Alkaline Diet

The alkaline diet includes fresh, nutrient-dense foods that are good for you. It doesn’t allow for added sugars or other junk foods that lack nutritional value. Though the science of the alkaline diet falls short, the eating habits it promotes can still offer health benefits.

**Does it allow for restrictions or preferences?**

If you’re a vegetarian or have food allergies, the alkaline diet may be easier for you to follow.

- **Vegetarians and vegans:** This diet is mostly vegetarian. It also works for vegans, since dairy is off-limits.

- **Gluten-free:** The diet excludes wheat, but to avoid gluten completely, you'll need to check food labels carefully, as gluten is not just in wheat.


Besides wheat, the diet nixes most of the other major triggers for food allergies, including milk, eggs, peanuts, walnuts, fish, and shellfish. It's also good for people who are trying to avoid fat and sugar.

**What else you should know**

You don't need to buy courses, books, or [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/default.htm) to follow the alkaline diet. There are many free alkaline food charts online that list foods you can buy at the grocery store.

There's no built-in exercise routine as part of the alkaline diet, which may make the diet easier to incorporate into your existing lifestyle.

## Disadvantages of the Alkaline Diet

The alkaline diet has some restrictions that may make it a difficult to maintain.

**Level of effort: high**

Some people find the alkaline diet hard to sustain because of the limitations it creates for what you can eat. You may have to cut out lots of foods that you're used to eating.

Many foods are restricted in an alkaline diet, including meat: This diet is almost entirely vegetarian. Most forms of dairy and meat is off-limits. In addition to the many foods that are off-limits, so are alcohol and caffeine. Because the diet cuts out meat, processed, and other acidic foods, it may be hard for some people to stick with.

Additionally, it's difficult to eat out on an alkaline diet, meaning you may be making more trips to the grocery store. If you're not used to cooking at home, it could take a while to learn how to prep and make your meals when you use fresh foods.

**What else you should know**

While there are lots of alkaline diet products available for purchase, they can be expensive. Know that you don’t need to spend money on specialized products to follow this diet.

## Alkaline Diet Review

While the alkaline diet may sound like it’s rooted in science, [Kathleen Zelman](https://www.webmd.com/bio/kathleen-m-zelman), MPH, RD, LD, a registered dietitian nutritionist, notes that there’s little evidence to support the claims that the diet can change your body's pH level. “You can’t change the alkaline of your blood,” says Zelman. While following an alkaline diet may be able to change the pH levels of your pee, this measure is not a reflection of the pH of your blood. Your body works to keep that level constant.

The health benefits that an alkaline diet can promote have nothing to do with your body's pH levels. “The diet advocates for fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes, as well as whole and unprocessed foods, and that’s the basis of a healthy diet,” says Zelman. But she stresses that a balanced diet also includes many of the foods that the alkaline diet restricts, like whole grains, dairy, and many forms of protein.

Another notable absence within the alkaline diet’s guidelines? “There’s no mention of exercise in this diet plan,” says Zelman. “It’s not just about what you eat. You have to get regular physical activity, too.” The American Heart Association and the CDC recommend getting at least 150 minutes of exercise each week. If you're new to exercise or have any medical problems, talk to your doctor before you change your exercise routines.

**Does the alkaline diet work?**

Maybe, but not for the reasons it claims.

While you could see weight loss with the alkaline diet, the results will likely be temporary. “When you start eliminating so many foods – sugar and alcohol and processed food – and most of your foods are fruits, vegetables, and lots of water, you’ll lose weight,” says Zelman. “But it’s not sustainable. Foods like protein are very satisfying. They keep your belly full. So do healthy fats.”

Zelman warns that fad diets like the alkaline diet may cause a yo-yo effect. If you often don’t feel full and return to your normal lifestyle, you’ll likely regain the weight that you lost -- and maybe even gain a few extra pounds. Ultimately, the restrictiveness of the alkaline diet may make it difficult to maintain for the long term.

Research is too limited to prove that eating more alkaline foods will help your body fight diseases like cancer.

**Is it good for certain conditions?**

In its most restrictive form, Zelman doesn’t recommend the alkaline diet for anyone, especially those with cancer, kidney disease, osteoporosis, or any other chronic health condition whose health could be impacted by the nutritional gaps that exist within the diet.

But there could be benefits to expanding upon the foundations of the alkaline diet by including eggs, dairy, whole grains, and protein to your plate, in addition to eating a more plant-based, unprocessed diet. Zelman notes that the emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and unprocessed foods in the alkaline diet may help someone reduce the amount of sugar, saturated fat, and sodium in their diet, which could benefit anyone with heart disease or diabetes.

But Zelman cautions anyone with a history of disordered eating against starting the alkaline diet: “When you categorize foods as good or bad -- like with alkanizing foods versus acidic foods -- it tends to promote eating disorders.”

Parents should avoid the alkaline diet for kids. Zelman notes that the diet eliminates important nutrient-rich foods like animal proteins, eggs, and fish that can be critical for their growth and development. “When you start having nutritional gaps, a diet becomes unsafe for children,” says Zelman.

Consult your health care provider before you make significant changes to your diet.

**The final word**

Following an alkaline diet will be tough for many people.

A lot of your favorite foods that are allowed in moderation in other plans (including lean meat, low-fat dairy, bread, and sweets) are forbidden here. Protein is limited to plant-based sources such as beans and tofu. This means you'll have to make sure you get enough protein and calcium from other sources.

Eating out can also be a challenge. If you travel a lot for work or have a busy schedule, you might feel bogged down by all the food selection and prep.

Given that many people will struggle with an alkaline diet because of its restrictiveness, Zelman stresses  that there’s space for a wide range of foods in a healthy diet. “In my opinion, all foods fit. You can have a healthy diet and still have room for -- granted, limited --  indulgences.” says Zelman. “Eighty percent of the time, your diet should be based on fundamentally good foods. But can you have some bacon? Can you have a piece of chocolate cake? Yes – those foods can fit in moderation and in the context of a healthy diet.”

Do the benefits of the alkaline diet outweigh its shortcomings? According to Zelman, no. “There are too many deficiencies and too many risks. It’s not sustainable, and there’s no evidence that it’s going to be healthful,” she says. “The best diet is the one you can stick with, so you need to find a plan that works for you, works for your lifestyle, but is also based on evidence.”

## Takeaways

The alkaline diet urges you to eat foods that are alkalizing and avoid those that are acidic. It includes nutritious options like fruits and veggies. Though the theory behind how the diet works is unproven, it may offer some benefits simply because it promotes healthy habits. It’s a good idea to talk to your doctor before you try any diet that limits food groups.

## Alkaline Diet FAQs

**Is the alkaline diet healthy?**

The alkaline diet encourages you to eat whole, healthy foods, such as vegetables and fruits. In this way, the diet can be a healthy option. But it also restricts many foods that can form a well-balanced and nutritious diet.

**How fast can I lose weight on the alkaline diet?**

It depends. Because the diet promotes eating healthy, low-calorie foods, you may lose weight, but this isn’t a guarantee. The diet isn't designed for sustainable weight loss.

**What are the best alkaline foods to eat?**

Alkalizing foods include non-starchy vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and some grains and legumes.

**What are 10 alkaline foods?**

Here are 10 alkalinizing foods:

01. Beets
02. Broccoli
03. Tomato
04. Garlic
05. Spinach
06. Apples
07. Cherries
08. Pineapple
09. Chestnuts
10. Pumpkin seeds

**What meat can you eat on the alkaline diet?**

The alkaline diet doesn’t allow for meat, dairy, or eggs. You may eat some plant-based protein, such as tofu.

## Phlebitis Overview

[Phlebitis](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/phlebitis) (fle-BYE-tis) means [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) of a vein. [Thrombophlebitis](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/understanding-thrombophlebitis-basics) is due to one or more [blood clots](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/blood-clots) in a vein that cause [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/women/ss/slideshow-what-is-inflammation). Thrombophlebitis usually occurs in leg veins, but it may occur in an arm or other parts of the body. The thrombus in the vein causes pain and irritation and may block [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) flow in the veins. Phlebitis can occur in both the surface (superficial) or deep veins.

- Superficial phlebitis affects veins on the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin) surface. The condition is rarely serious and, with proper care, usually resolves rapidly. Sometimes people with superficial phlebitis also get deep vein thrombophlebitis, so a medical evaluation is necessary.
- Deep vein thrombophlebitis affects the larger [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cm/rm-quiz-blood-basics) vessels, usually deep in the legs. Large blood clots can form, which may break off and travel to the [lungs](https://www.webmd.com/lung/healthy-lungs-smokers-lungs). This is a serious condition called [pulmonary embolism](https://www.webmd.com/lung/what-is-a-pulmonary-embolism).

## Phlebitis Causes

Superficial phlebitis can be a complication due to a medical or surgical procedure.

Injury to a vein increases the risk of forming a blood clot. Sometimes clots occur without an injury. Some risk factors for thrombophlebitis include the following:

- Prolonged inactivity - Staying in bed or sitting for many hours, as in a car or on an airplane, creating stagnant or slow flow of blood from the legs in a dependent position (This pooling of blood in the legs leads to thrombus formation.)
- Sedentary lifestyle - Not getting any exercise
- Obesity
- Smoking cigarettes
- Certain medical conditions, such as [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm) or [blood disorders](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/blood-disorder-types-and-treatment), that increase the clotting potential of the blood
- Injury to your arms or legs
- [Hormone replacement therapy](https://www.webmd.com/menopause/menopause-hormone-therapy) or [birth control pills](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills)
- Pregnancy
- [Varicose veins](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-varicose-veins-basics)

## Phlebitis Symptoms

**Superficial phlebitis**

There is usually a slow onset of a tender red area along the superficial veins on the skin. A long, thin red area may be seen as the inflammation follows a superficial vein. This area may feel hard, warm, and tender. The skin around the vein may be itchy and swollen. The area may begin to throb or burn.

Symptoms may be worse when the leg is lowered, especially when first getting out of bed in the morning. A low-grade fever may occur. Sometimes phlebitis may occur where a peripheral intravenous line was started. The surrounding area may be sore and tender along the vein.

If an infection is present, symptoms may include redness, fever, pain, swelling, or breakdown of the skin.

**Deep vein phlebitis**

This can be similar in presentation to superficial phlebitis, but some people may have no symptoms.

One may have pain and swelling throughout the entire limb. For example, the lower leg may swell for no apparent reason. Some people also get fever from a superimposed [bacterial infection](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/bacterial-and-viral-infections) and skin discoloration or ulcers if the condition becomes chronic and was inadequately treated earlier.

## When to Seek Medical Care

Call your health care provider if you have signs and symptoms of swelling, pain, and inflamed superficial veins on the arms or legs. If you are not better in a week or two or if it gets any worse, get reevaluated to make sure you don't have a more serious condition.

Deep vein thrombophlebitis requires immediate medical care. If you have any of these signs and symptoms, go to a hospital emergency department for evaluation:

- [High fever](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/fevers-causes-symptoms-treatments) with any symptoms in an arm or leg
- Lumps in a leg
- Severe pain and swelling in an arm or leg
- New, unexplained shortness of breath, which could be the first tip-off that a blood clot has already traveled to your [lung](https://www.webmd.com/lung/cm/rm-quiz-lungs-quiz); call 911if you are having trouble breathing.

## Exams and Tests

Your [health care](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/cm/rm-quiz-insurance-basics) provider will examine you and ask questions about your symptoms.

**D-dimer** is a blood test that measures a substance that is released as a blood clot dissolves. If this blood test is negative, and you have no risk factors, then it is unlikely that you have a blood clot.

[Ultrasound](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-an-ultrasound) can detect clots or blockage of blood flow, especially in larger, more proximal (upper leg) veins. A small hand-held instrument (probe) is pressed against your skin to help identify blood clots and where the obstruction is. This is a painless, noninvasive test.

Occasionally a venogram is needed to identify blood clots in the smaller, more distal veins. This is an invasive procedure that requires injecting X-ray dye or contrast material into a vein on the foot, then an X-ray is taken of the flow of the dye up the leg.

## Phlebitis Treatment Self-Care at Home

An anti-inflammatory drug, such as [aspirin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-3-ASPIRIN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=1082&drugname=Aspirin+Oral) or [ibuprofen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-9368-IBUPROFEN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5166&drugname=ibuprofen+oral), can help lessen the pain and inflammation of superficial phlebitis. But check with your doctor first.

If you increase your walking, you increase blood flow. This helps prevent blood clots from developing.

Prescription leg [compression stockings](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/choose-compression-stockings) ( [knee](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/knee-pain-overview) or thigh high) improve your blood flow and may help to relieve your pain and swelling.

Avoid [bed rest](https://www.webmd.com/baby/bed-rest-during-pregnancy) for prolonged periods. It can make your symptoms worse.

If you have deep vein thrombophlebitis, you may need to stay in the hospital for a few days for diagnosis and treatment to ensure that no complications occur.

## Medical Treatment

If your evaluation shows superficial phlebitis and you are otherwise healthy, you can likely go home. You will need to use compression stockings and probably anti-inflammatory [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) to control your symptoms. Additional management involves elevation of the arm/leg and application of warm compresses. Only a few cases require [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cm/rm-quiz-antibiotics-myths-facts).

If you have a history of deep vein thrombophlebitis, or if the phlebitis might possibly spread to the deep veins, you will need to take a [blood thinner](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ss/slideshow-tips-for-taking-blood-thinners) (anticoagulant). The duration of anticoagulant treatment ranges from 3 to 12 months.

If you have signs of infection, you will need to take an antibiotic.

If the superficial phlebitis has progressed to involve the deep veins, then it is a serious condition that may even require hospital admission for treatment and further evaluation.

## Next Steps Outlook

Phlebitis in the superficial veins is rarely serious and usually responds to pain control, elevation, and warm compresses for 1-2 weeks.

When allergies make your nose stuffed up, an [antihistamine](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/antihistamines-for-allergies) generally doesn't help. But a decongestant might.

Here's how [decongestants](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants) work: [Allergies](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergy-symptoms) make the lining of your nose swell. [Decongestants](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/video/video-decongestants-vs-antihistamines) shrink swollen [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) vessels and tissues. That relieves the congestion. But decongestants can’t help with [sneezing](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/know-your-allergy-triggers) or [itching](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-pruritus).

Decongestants come in pills, liquids, nose drops, and nasal sprays. Many are available without a prescription. Common decongestants include:

- [Afrin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-54203/afrinol+oral/details), Dristan, Vicks [Sinex](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-4653/sinex+regular+nasal/details) ( [oxymetazoline](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-20236/oxymetazoline-menthol+nasal/details))
- [Sudafed](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6573/sudafed+oral/details) PE ( [phenylephrine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-21821/phenylephrine+oral/details))
- [Silfedrine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-54195/silfedrine+oral/details), Sudafed ( [pseudoephedrine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-55306/pseudoephedrine+dx+oral/details))

Some over-the-counter decongestants -- those with pseudoephedrine -- are found behind the pharmacy counter.

Many medicines combine an antihistamine and decongestant, like [Allegra](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5485/allegra-d+12+hour+oral/details)-D, [Benadryl](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5680/benadryl+oral/details) [Allergy](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergy-test-facts) Plus [Sinus](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinus-tips), [Claritin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5346/claritin+oral/details)-D, and [Zyrtec](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-12127/zyrtec+oral/details)-D.

Don’t use decongestant nasal sprays longer than three days. Using them longer can actually make your nose more stopped up when you stop them.

Ask your doctor before taking decongestants if you have:

- [Glaucoma](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/glaucoma-eyes)
- High blood pressure that’s not under control
- [Heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/high-cholesterol-healthy-heart) conditions
- [Thyroid problems](https://www.webmd.com/women/understanding-thyroid-problems-basics)
- [Enlarged prostate](https://www.webmd.com/men/enlarged-prostate-bph-8/default.htm)
- Diabetes

Decongestants make some people feel jittery or have trouble sleeping. If that happens, cut back on [caffeine](https://www.webmd.com/diet/caffeine-myths-and-facts) while taking them. If that doesn't help, you may need to stop taking them. Nasal sprays are less likely to cause these problems and may be a short-term solution.

## Antibiotics for Sinus Infection

People with painful [sinus](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinus-tips) problems often plead with their doctors to give them an antibiotic as soon as possible. About 83% of adults seen in the U.S. by a doctor for acute sinusitisend up getting an antibiotic, research shows. And most don't need it.

Acute sinusitis is a sinus infection that lasts less than 4 weeks, while chronic sinusitis lasts longer than 12 weeks. Infections of the sinuses (hollow air spaces within the bones in the cheekbones, forehead, and between the eyes) are usually caused by viral or bacterial infections. They cause thick mucus blockage and discomfort in the cavities.

But antibiotics may not always be the best remedy for sinusitis. Your body should be able to cure itself of a mild or moderate sinusitis, and you should avoid [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/video/josephson-antibiotics) that can cause antibiotic resistance.

Many medical guidelines, including those issued jointly by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, now recommend the judicious (cautious) use of antibiotics.

## Antibiotics for Sinus Infections

The guidelines were triggered, in part, by studies finding that antibiotics may not make a difference. About 60%-70% of people with sinus infections recover without antibiotics, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

In one study of symptom relief, patients given antibiotics generally did no better than patients not given antibiotics.

This study, published in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, observed 240 patients with [sinusitis](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinusitis-and-sinus-infection). They were given one of four treatments: antibiotics alone, nasal steroid spray alone to reduce tissue swelling, both antibiotics and the spray, or no treatment.

Patients who got no treatment were as likely to get better as those who got the antibiotics. The nasal spray seemed to help people with less severe symptoms at the beginning of their sinus problems and seemed to worsen the condition of those with more intense congestion.

All patients had sinus symptoms that suggested a bacterial infection. However, sinus problems can also be caused by viruses, for which antibiotics definitely offer no help.

## Is Your Sinus Infection Caused by a Virus or Bacteria?

Doctors may not know if sinusitis is bacterial or viral because the diagnosis is typically done by observing symptoms. Symptoms include:

- Nasal congestion
- Pain or discomfort around the eyes, forehead, or cheeks
- Cough
- Headache
- Thick nasal or post-nasal drainage
- Fever

Sometimes other tests such as a CT scan or cultures are used to help make the diagnosis.

Some doctors give patients with sinusitis a prescription for antibiotics and recommend them to wait 3-5 days before filling it. They suggest their patients fill it only if their symptoms are not better by then. The longer the symptoms last, the more likely a sinus problem is to be a bacterial infection, some experts say. A [decongestant](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants) can be used to help relieve your symptoms and promote drainage.

Know that just 2% of sinus infections are caused by bacteria, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The vast majority of infections are caused by a virus.

## When to Take Antibiotics for Sinus Infection

You may get antibiotics if:

- You're less able to fight off infections (for instance, if you have diabetes, or a serious heart or lung disease).
- Your symptoms have gotten worse or shown no improvement after 5 days.

If antibiotics are given, you normally take it for 10 to 14 days.

**Signs of a sinus infection getting better with antibiotics**

After about a week of being on antibiotics, you should see that:

- Your fever has reduced.
- Your nose is no longer stuffy and filled with mucus.
- Your headache and sinus pain have reduced.

If you've been on antibiotics and nothing changes after 7-10 days, you likely have a [viral infection](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/bacterial-and-viral-infections). This is why your doctor might tell you to wait a few days before filling a prescription for antibiotics, to see whether symptoms start to clear up on their own.

## Best Antibiotics for Sinusitis

Your doctor might give you one of the following sinus infection antibiotics for your bacterial sinusitis:

**Amoxicillin for sinus infection**

Amoxicillin (Amoxil) or [amoxicillin clavulanate](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1922-5050/amoxicillin-potassium-clavulanate-oral/amoxicillin-clavulanic-acid-suspension-oral/details) (Augmentin) are typically the first recommendations for people not allergic to penicillin.

Amoxicillin is a penicillin-like antibiotic used to treat all kinds of infections, including chest, ear, and sinus infections. It stops the growth of bacteria. Clavulanate prevents bacteria from destroying amoxicillin, so the combination of the two drugs is preferred by doctors over just amoxicillin.

**Doxycycline for sinus infection**

This drug belongs to a class of medicines called tetracycline antibiotics. It's used to kill bacteria or prevent its growth. If you're allergic to penicillin, your doctor may prescribe this. Doxycycline (Doryx, Periostat) is also used to treat acne and [anthrax](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/what-is-anthrax).

**Azithromycin for sinus infection**

Azithromycin (Z-Pak) is usually given as a 5-day treatment course and is very popular. But the Infectious Diseases Society of America now warns against using it to treat sinusitis, as its overuse has led to the development of drug resistance. It stops the growth of bacteria and is also used to treat bronchitis, pneumonia, and sexually transmitted diseases, among other infections. Azithromycin belongs to a class of drugs called macrolides.

**Other drugs used to treat sinus infections include:**

- Cefixime (Suprax)
- Cefpodoxime (Vantin)
- Clindamycin (Cleocin)
- Fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin, Cipro)

## Antibiotics for Sinus Infection While Pregnant

Not all antibiotics can be given to you while you're pregnant. Some are OK but others aren't

It's not a good idea to take macrolide antibiotics or doxycycline for sinusitis when you're pregnant. Penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics are safer, especially if there's evidence of pus in your sinuses.

Other antibiotics such as tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones can harm the baby, so they shouldn't be used during pregnancy.

## Feeling Worse After Starting Antibiotics for Sinus Infection

If you've been on sinus infection antibiotics for 7 days and your symptoms are the same or worse, let your doctor know. They may have to put you on a different antibiotic since many bacteria are now immune to certain antibiotics.

It's also possible that your sinus infection is not bacterial but viral. Or you might have something more serious, like a blockage in your nasal cavity. In order to see that, your doctor would need to give you a [CT scan](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-is-a-ct-scan), which is an imaging test. You may get this if you've tried two different antibiotics that didn't work.

## Best Over-the-Counter Medicine for Sinus Infection

Here are some sinus infection medicines you can get at your drugstore that can help with your symptoms:

- For sinus pain and headaches, try acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Aleve, Motrin).
- For a stuffy nose, try a decongestant (such as Afrin, Dristan, or Sudafed) or nasal spray (Flonase, Nasonex).
- You could also buy a saltwater spray or make your own [saline solution](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/saline-spray) [to treat your stuffy nose.](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/saline-spray)

Getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids will also help you recover.

## Takeaways

Antibiotics shouldn't be your first choice if you have a sinus infection because most of these infections are caused by viruses, and antibiotics only work on bacteria. But if your sinusitis is caused by bacteria, your doctor may prescribe amoxicillin clavulanate or doxycycline (if you're allergic to penicillin) to help you get well. Most of the time, sinus infections will go away on their own without any special medication, though you can take over-the-counter pills to help with the pain.

## Antibiotics for Sinus Infection FAQs

**How long does it take for a sinus infection to go away without antibiotics?**

Most sinus infections (about 70%) go away within 2 weeks without any antibiotics.

**What makes sinusitis worse?**

Cigarette smoke, dry air, pollutants, hay fever, and changes in air pressure are just some of the things that make sinusitis worse.

## What Is Pericoronitis?

Pericoronitis is an inflammation or swelling of your gum tissue. It’s more common in your lower teeth and it usually happens around your [wisdom teeth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/wisdom-teeth-adult), the third and final set of [molars](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-health-your-childs-teeth) that most people get in their late teens or early 20s.

## Pericoronitis Causes

Pericoronitis can develop when [wisdom teeth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-tooth-problems) only partially erupt (break through the gum). Soft tissue growth over a partially erupted wisdom tooth is called an operculum. Bacteria can get trapped under the operculum. That allows an opening for bacteria to enter around the [tooth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/picture-of-the-teeth) and cause infection and swelling. Food debris, bacteria, or plaque, a bacterial film that remains on [teeth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/rm-quiz-teeth-truth) after eating, may also get caught underneath the gingiva, a flap of gum around a [tooth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/dental-care-smile-10/slideshow-pretty-teeth). If it stays there, it can irritate the gum and lead to pericoronitis. In serious cases, the swelling and infection may extend beyond the jaw to the cheeks and neck.

## Pericoronitis Risk Factors

Factors that may raise your risk of pericoronitis include:

- Being in your 20s
- An upper respiratory tract infections
- Emotional stress
- Poor oral hygiene

## Pericoronitis Symptoms

Symptoms of pericoronitis can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (be ongoing).

Acute symptoms include:

- [Pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm)
- Swelling in the gum tissue (caused by an accumulation of fluid)
- Pus discharge
- Trismus, or difficulty opening your mouth and jaw, also called lockjaw
- Pain with swallowing
- [Fever](https://www.webmd.com/covid/what-is-a-fever)
- Loss of appetite
- Infection
- Swollen submandibular [lymph nodes](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-are-lymph-nodes) in the neck

Chronic symptoms include:

- Occasional dull pain or mild discomfort
- A bad taste in the mouth

## Pericoronitis Diagnosis

Your [dentist](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/oral-health-care-providers) will examine your [wisdom teeth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/wisdom-teeth) to see how they are coming in, and determine if they are partially erupted. They may take an X-ray periodically to determine the alignment of the [wisdom teeth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-wisdom-teeth). Your dentist will also take note of any symptoms such as swelling or infection, and will check for the presence of a gum flap around a wisdom tooth.

## Pericoronitis Treatment

Pericoronitis is treated by your general [dentist](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/oral-health-care-providers) or one of these specialists:

- Pedodontist or pediatric dentist
- Endodontist
- Periodontist
- Prosthodontist
- Oral surgeon

Treatments for pericoronitis include:

- **Oral hygiene/oral irrigators and rinses:** If the pericoronitis is in a small area and hasn’t spread, treatment may be rinsing your [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/rm-quiz-mouth-myths) with warm salt water. Your dentist can flush out food debris or bacteria, or give you an oral rinse. You’ll need to make sure to keep the gum flap free of any food trapped.
- **Pain medicine:** You can take pain relievers such as [aspirin](https://www.webmd.com/heart/cm/rm-quiz-aspirin), [acetaminophen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-362/acetaminophen+oral/details), or ibuprofen. Your dentist may also prescribe you a pain [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx).
- **Antibiotics:** If your tooth, jaw, and cheek are swollen and painful, see your dentist right away. They can treat the infection with [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/rm-quiz-antibiotics-myths-facts) (usually [penicillin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3781/penicillin+g+benzathine+intramuscular/details), unless you are allergic).
- **Minor surgery to remove the operculum:** If the pain and [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) are severe, or if the pericoronitis recurs, it may be necessary to have oral surgery to remove the gum flap or wisdom tooth. Your dentist can make the appropriate referral to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. A low-level laser can be used to reduce pain and [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/women/ss/slideshow-what-is-inflammation) associated with pericoronitis.
- **Extraction:** If a wisdom tooth still can’t come in normally, you may need surgery to have it taken out. Your dentist may recommend you extract both your upper and lower wisdom teeth to prevent your upper tooth from biting your gum and causing another infection.

## What Is Delusional Disorder?

[Delusional disorder](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/delusional-disorder), previously called [paranoid](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/features/why-feel-paranoid) disorder, is a type of serious [mental illness](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/default.htm) called a psychotic disorder. People who have it can’t tell what’s real from what is imagined.

Delusions are the main symptom of delusional disorder. They’re unshakable beliefs in something that isn’t true or based on reality. But that doesn’t mean they’re completely unrealistic. Delusional disorder can involve delusions that aren’t bizarre, having to do with situations that could happen in real life, like being followed, poisoned, deceived, conspired against, or loved from a distance. These delusions usually involve mistaken perceptions or experiences. But in reality, the situations are either not true at all or highly exaggerated.

A bizarre delusion, by contrast, is something that could never happen in real life, such as being cloned by aliens or having your thoughts broadcast on TV. A person who has such thoughts might be considered delusional with bizarre-type delusions.

People with delusional disorder often can continue to socialize and function normally, apart from the subject of their delusion, and generally do not behave in an obviously odd or bizarre manner. This is unlike people with other [psychotic disorders](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/mental-health-psychotic-disorders), who also might have delusions as a symptom of their disorder. But in some cases, people with delusional disorder might become so preoccupied with their delusions that their lives are disrupted.

Although delusions might be a symptom of more common disorders, such as [schizophrenia](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/mental-health-schizophrenia), delusional disorder itself is rather rare. Delusional disorder most often happens in middle to late life and is slightly more common in women than in men.

**Delusion vs. hallucination**

A person with a delusion believes something that isn't true no matter how much evidence you give to the contrary. For example, they may believe a family member is trying to poison them.

Hallucinations involve the senses – seeing, feeling, or hearing something that isn't there, for example.

**Delusional disorder vs. schizophrenia**

Schizophrenia is a break with reality that may involve delusions or hallucinations but includes other symptoms too. People with schizophrenia can have trouble with personal and professional relationships or with controlling their thoughts and behaviors. People with delusional disorder usually have no symptoms of mental illness other than their delusion.

## Delusion Types

The diagnostic criteria for delusional disorder, according to the American Psychiatric Association DSM 5, is a person having delusions for over a month who otherwise seems mentally and emotionally unimpaired. Types of delusional disorder are based on the main theme of the delusion:

- **Erotomanic:** The person believes someone is in [love](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/cm/rm-quiz-science-love) with them and might try to contact that person. Often, it’s someone important or famous. This can lead to stalking behavior.
- **Grandiose:** This person has an over-inflated sense of worth, power, knowledge, or identity. They could believe they have a great talent or made an important discovery.
- **Jealous:** A person with delusional disorder jealous type believes their spouse or sexual partner is unfaithful.
- **Persecutory:** Someone who has this believes they (or someone close to them) are being mistreated, or that someone is spying on them or planning to harm them. They might make repeated complaints to legal authorities.
- **Bizarre:** These delusions involve believing something impossible in our reality, such as aliens taking over your friend's body.
- **Somatic:** They believe they have a physical defect or medical problem.
- **Thought broadcasting:** The idea that your thoughts are being transmitted and heard through public mediums like TV, radio, or the internet.
- **Thought insertion:** The idea that thoughts are being imposed on you by outside forces.
- **Mixed:** Two or more of the types of delusions listed above.
- **Unspecified:** The primary type of delusion cannot be identified.

## Symptoms of Delusional Disorder

Symptoms usually include:

- Non-bizarre delusions – these are the most obvious symptom
- Cranky, angry, or low mood
- Anxiety or depression
- [Hallucinations](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/what-are-hallucinations) (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that aren’t really there) related to the delusion. For example, someone who believes they have an odor problem might smell a bad odor.
- An inability to see the delusions as false or troublesome
- A belief that others are taking advantage of them
- Mistrusting friends and family
- Outsized reactions to perceived slights or harmless remarks and incidents
- A tendency to hold grudges

**Alcoholic delusions**

To receive a diagnosis of delusional disorder, you must have delusions despite abusing drugs or alcohol, even though people with substance use disorders frequently have delusions. To heavy alcohol or drug users, delusions can seem magnified and may lead to excessive reactions or dangerous behaviors.

## Causes of Delusional Disorder

As with many other psychotic disorders, the exact cause of delusional disorder is not yet known. But researchers are looking at the role of genetic, biological, environmental, or psychological factors that make it more likely.

- **Genetic:** The fact that delusional disorder is more common in people who have family members with delusional disorder or schizophrenia suggests genes may be involved. It is believed that, as with other mental disorders, a tendency to have delusional disorder might be passed on from parents to their children.
- **Biological:** Researchers are studying how delusional disorders might happen when parts of the brain aren’t normal. Abnormal [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-diseases) regions that control perception and thinking may be linked to the delusional symptoms.
- **Environmental/psychological:** Evidence suggests that [stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/default.htm) can trigger delusional disorder. [Alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/cm/rm-quiz-alcohol-myths-facts) and [drug abuse](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/abuse-of-prescription-drugs) also might contribute to it. People who tend to be isolated, such as immigrants or those with poor sight and hearing, appear to be more likely to have delusional disorder.

## Diagnosing Delusional Disorder

If you have symptoms of delusional disorder, your doctor will likely give you a complete medical history and [physical exam](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/annual-physical-examinations).

**Differential diagnoses**

Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose delusional disorder, the doctor might use diagnostic tests, such as imaging studies or [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) tests, to rule out physical or other psychiatric illnesses as the cause of the symptoms. These include:

- Alzheimer’s disease
- [Epilepsy](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/default.htm)
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Bipolar disorder
- Personality disorders
- Delirium
- Other schizophrenia spectrum disorders

**Uncovering a diagnosis**

If the doctor finds no physical reason for the symptoms, they might refer the person to a [psychiatrist](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/guide-to-psychiatry-and-counseling) or psychologist, [health care](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/default.htm) professionals trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. They’ll use interview and assessment tools to evaluate the person for a psychotic disorder.

The doctor or therapist bases the diagnosis on the person's symptoms and their own observation of the person's attitude and behavior. They’ll decide if the symptoms point to a disorder.

A diagnosis of delusional disorder is made if:

- The person has one or more delusions that last a month or longer.
- The person has never been diagnosed with schizophrenia; [hallucinations](https://www.webmd.com/brain/why-am-i-seeing-things), if they have them, are related to the themes of their delusions.
- Apart from the delusions and its effects, their life isn’t really affected. Their other behavior isn’t bizarre or odd.
- Manic or major depressive episodes, if they’ve happened, have been brief, when compared with the delusions.
- There isn’t another mental disorder, [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx), or medical condition to blame.

## Treatment for Delusional Disorder

Treatment most often includes medication and psychotherapy (a type of [counseling](https://www.webmd.com/balance/video/farrell-therapy-counseling)). Delusional disorder can be very difficult to treat, in part because those who have it often have poor insight and do not know there’s a psychiatric problem. Studies show that close to half of patients treated with antipsychotic medications show at least partial improvement.

The primary medications used to attempt to treat delusional disorder are called antipsychotics. Drugs used include:

- **Conventional antipsychotics:** Also called neuroleptics, these have been used to treat mental disorders since the mid-1950s. They work by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter believed to be involved in the development of delusions. Conventional antipsychotics include:
  - [Chlorpromazine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-1444-chlorpromazine+oral.aspx) ( [Thorazine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-9543-thorazine+oral.aspx))
  - [Fluphenazine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-8891-fluphenazine+hcl+inj.aspx) ( [Prolixin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-9445-prolixin+inj.aspx))
  - [Haloperidol](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-6092-haloperidol+decanoate+im.aspx) ( [Haldol](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-14677-haldol+inj.aspx))
  - [Loxapine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-5557-loxapine+hcl+oral.aspx) (Oxilapine)
  - [Perphenazine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-8825-perphenazine+oral.aspx) ( [Trilafon](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-7068-trilafon+oral.aspx))
  - Thioridazine (Mellaril)
  - [Thiothixene](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-6234-thiothixene+oral.aspx) ( [Navane](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-6923-navane+oral.aspx))
  - [Trifluoperazine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11998/trifluoperazine+oral/details) (Stelazine)
- **Atypical antipsychotics:** These newer drugs appear to help treat the symptoms of delusional disorder with fewer movement-related side effects than the older typical antipsychotics. They work by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter believed to be involved in delusional disorder. These drugs include:
  - [Aripiprazole](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-64439/abilify+oral/details) (Abilify)
  - [Aripiprazole lauroxil](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-175570/aripiprazole+lauroxil%2c+submicronized+intramuscular/details) (Aristada)
  - Asenapine (Saphris)
  - [Brexpiprazole](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-169290/brexpiprazole-oral/details) ( [Rexulti](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-169294/rexulti+oral/details))
  - Cariprazine (Vraylar)
  - [Clozapine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-5200-clozapine+oral.aspx) ( [Clozaril](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-5194-clozaril+oral.aspx))
  - Iloperidone (Fanapt)
  - Olanzapine ( [Zyprexa](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1699/zyprexa-oral/details))
  - [Lurasidone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-155126/lurasidone-oral/details) ( [Latuda](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-155134/latuda+oral/details))
  - [Paliperidone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-146718-paliperidone+oral.aspx) ( [Invega](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-146745-invega+oral.aspx) Sustenna)
  - Paliperidone Palmitate (Invega Trinza)
  - [Quetiapine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-8274-QUETIAPINE+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=4689&drugname=quetiapine+fumarate+oral) ( [Seroquel](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-4718-seroquel+oral.aspx))
  - [Risperidone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-2034-RISPERIDONE+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=6283&drugname=risperidone+oral) (Risperdal)
  - [Ziprasidone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-20568-ziprasidone+hcl+oral.aspx) ( [Geodon](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-20575-geodon+oral.aspx))

**Other medications:** Sedatives and [antidepressants](https://www.webmd.com/depression/depression-medications-antidepressants) might also be used to treat [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/default.htm) or mood symptoms if they happen with delusional disorder. Tranquilizers might be used if the person has a very high level of [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/cm/rm-quiz-stress-anxiety) or problems sleeping. [Antidepressants](https://www.webmd.com/depression/video/anti-depressants-and-weight-gain) might be used to treat [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/default.htm), which often happens in people with delusional disorder.

Psychotherapy can also be helpful, along with medications, as a way to help people better manage and cope with the stresses related to their delusional beliefs and the impact on their lives. Psychotherapies that may be helpful in delusional disorder:

- **Individual psychotherapy** can help the person recognize and correct the thinking that has become distorted.
- **Cognitive behavioral** [**therapy**](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-psychotherapy) **(CBT)** can help the person learn to recognize and change thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome feelings.
- **Family therapy** can help families deal with or support a loved one who has delusional disorder.

People with severe symptoms or who are at risk of hurting themselves or others might need to be hospitalized until the condition is stabilized.

## Complications of Delusional Disorder

- People may develop anxiety due to their delusions.
- People with delusional disorder might become depressed, often as the result of personal or professional problems that come with the delusions.
- Acting on the delusions also can lead to violence or legal problems. For example, a person with an erotomanic delusion who stalks or harasses the object of the delusion could be arrested.
- People with this disorder can become alienated from others, especially if their delusions interfere with or damage their [relationships](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/default.htm).

## Delusional Disorder Prognosis

It varies, depending on the person, the type of delusional disorder, and the person's life circumstances, including the presence of support and a willingness to stick with treatment.

Delusional disorder is typically a chronic (ongoing) condition. But when properly treated, many people can find relief from their symptoms. Some recover completely, while others have bouts of delusional beliefs with periods of remission (lack of symptoms).

Unfortunately, many people with this disorder don’t seek help. It’s often hard for people with a mental disorder to know they aren’t well. Or they may credit their symptoms to other things, like the environment. They also might be too embarrassed or afraid to seek treatment. Without treatment, delusional disorder can be a lifelong illness.

## Can Delusional Disorder Be Prevented?

There’s no known way to prevent delusional disorder. But early diagnosis and treatment can help lessen the disruption to a person's life, family, and relationships.

## How to Help Someone Who Has Delusions

You can support friends and family members with delusional disorder and encourage them to seek treatment. The earlier they seek help, the less impact delusional disorder may have on their life.

Other things you can do:

**Avoid criticism.** Judgment may make a person with delusions feel anxious, alone, or depressed. Temper your tone and talk to your loved one calmly.

**Learn more.** You can help your loved one understand their diagnosis and decide among treatment options.

**Avoid argument.** Don't tell your loved one their delusions are false. They may withdraw further and resist your efforts to help **.**

**Be prepared.** Make plans for a crisis and have a plan in case your loved one is in danger of hurting themselves or others.

If you are a caregiver for a person with delusional disorder, it's important to take care of yourself as well.

## Takeaways

It's difficult for people with delusional disorder to recognize their illness and seek help. That's because they are usually still able to function and appear to be acting normally. When people do seek treatment, it's important to stay the course. Nearly half of those who do have a complete recovery.

## Delusional Disorders FAQs

**What are the signs of delusional disorder?**

A person may have a delusional disorder if they are totally convinced something is true that to others is demonstrably false.

## Month One of Pregnancy

The amniotic sac is a water-tight sac that forms around the fertilized egg. It helps cushion the growing embryo throughout pregnancy.

The [placenta](https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-is-an-anterior-placenta-during-pregnancy) also develops at this point in the first trimester. The placenta is a round, flat organ that transfers nutrients from the mother to the baby, and transfers waste from the baby.

A primitive face takes form with large dark circles for eyes. The mouth, lower jaw, and throat are developing. Blood cells are taking shape, and circulation will begin.

By the end of the first month of pregnancy, your baby is around 6-7mm (1/4 inch) long - about the size of a grain of rice!

![](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_and_medical_reference/womens_health/Pregnancy_Your_Babys_Growth_and_Development_Months_1_to_3_-_End_of_First_Month.jpg)

## Month Two of Pregnancy

Your baby's facial features continue to develop. Each ear begins as a little fold of skin at the side of the head. Tiny buds that eventually grow into arms and legs are forming. Fingers, toes, and eyes are also forming in the second month of pregnancy.

The neural tube (brain, spinal cord, and other neural tissue of the central nervous system) is well formed. The digestive tract and sensory organs begin to develop. Bone starts to replace cartilage. The embryo begins to move, although the mother cannot yet feel it.

By the end of the second month, your baby, now a fetus, is about 2.54cm (1 inch) long, weighs about 9.45g (1/3 ounce), and a third of baby is now made up of its head.

## Month Three of Pregnancy

By the end of the third month of pregnancy, your baby is fully formed. Your baby has arms, hands, fingers, feet, and toes and can open and close its fists and mouth. Fingernails and toenails are beginning to develop and the external ears are formed. The beginnings of teeth are forming. Your baby's reproductive organs also develop, but the baby's gender is difficult to distinguish on ultrasound. The circulatory and urinary systems are working and the liver produces bile.

At the end of the third month, your baby is about 7.6 -10 cm (3-4 inches) long and weighs about 28g (1 ounce).

![](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_and_medical_reference/womens_health/Pregnancy_Your_Babys_Growth_and_Development_Months_1_to_3_-_12_Weeks.jpg)

Since your baby's most critical development has taken place, your chance of [miscarriage](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-miscarriage) drops considerably after three months into the pregnancy.

Benfotiamine is a lab-made version of vitamin B1, also called thiamine. Scientists are studying it to see if it might help conditions like [diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm)-related [nerve damage](https://www.webmd.com/brain/nerve-pain-and-nerve-damage-symptoms-and-causes), Alzheimer’s disease, and [alcohol dependence](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/understanding-alcohol-abuse-basics).

Early research into the potential benefits of benfotiamine has shown some promise. But more evidence is needed to back up its health claims.

## What’s the Health Link?

Thiamine, the natural version of benfotiamine, is a B vitamin you get from foods like [whole grains](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/guide/vitamins-and-minerals-good-food-sources), meat, legumes, and nuts. It helps cells in your body grow and work.

[Thiamine deficiency](https://www.webmd.com/brain/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome-facts) \-\- when you don’t get enough thiamine -- is rare in the U.S. But low levels of it may be linked to certain health problems, including diabetes and Alzheimer’s. Researchers want to know if boosting those levels with [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/diet/vitamin-supplement-glossary) might help.

Your body might have a hard time absorbing thiamine. That’s where benfotiamine comes in. Benfotiamine, which turns into thiamine once it’s inside your body, may build up to helpful levels more easily.

Here’s what the research on this supplement says.

## Diabetes Complications

Some early research suggests that benfotiamine on its own or with other B vitamins might ease symptoms of nerve damage, or neuropathy, in people with type 1 or [type 2 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes). But the studies were small and lasted only weeks. Other research has found no benefits to the nerves.

It’s also unclear if benfotiamine may help prevent or treat other [diabetes complications](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/risks-complications-uncontrolled-diabetes) like [heart failure](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/default.htm), [kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information) (nephropathy), and [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes) damage (retinopathy).

## Alzheimer’s Disease

The National Institute on Aging is funding a small pilot study to look at whether benfotiamine could slow the decline of mental skills, like thinking and remembering, in people with mild Alzheimer’s. If the results show promise, that may pave the way for more research.

So far, there have been no large, well-designed studies on benfotiamine as a treatment for Alzheimer’s.

## Alcohol Dependence

A long-term drinking problem can lower your body’s levels of thiamine, the natural version of benfotiamine.

One small study suggests that a high daily dose of benfotiamine may help curb drinking in women with [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/cm/rm-quiz-alcohol-myths-facts) use disorder. Another study found it may ease mental distress in men who’ve stopped drinking to recover from severe alcoholism.

Still, much more research is needed.

## What to Watch For

Some supplement makers claim that benfotiamine is good for your [blood sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes), nerves, or [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function). Be wary of the hype. And talk to your doctor before you try it.

Tell them about any [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) or other supplements you take. They can check to see if benfotiamine might affect the way your meds work. Ask your doctor which brand you should buy, and how much and for how long you should use it.

In certain studies, people who took 300-600 milligrams of benfotiamine by [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems) every day saw no serious side effects. But it could give you a [skin rash](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/common-rashes) if you’re prone to [allergies](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/default.htm).

## Daily Calorie Intake

Whether you're trying to lose weight, gain weight, or stick to your current weight, it's important to know how many calories you need to eat each day.

Daily calorie intake is different for each person. It depends on a few things, like your age, sex, and activity level. In general, people assigned male at birth need more calories because their bodies are larger. And people who are more active need more calories than less active people. In your senior years, you need fewer calories due to changes in your [metabolism](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/how-to-boost-your-metabolism).

## Calorie Intake Chart

This chart shows estimated calorie needs. It should only be used as a reference point because everybody's metabolism is different, even when they are the same size, sex, and age.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sex (at birth)** | **Age (years)** | **Sedentary** | **Moderately Active** | **Active** |
| Child | 2-3 | 1,000 | 1,000-1,400 | 1,000-1,400 |
| Female | 4-8<br>9-13<br>14-18<br>19-30<br>31-50<br>51+ | 1,200-1,400<br>1,400-1,600<br>1,800<br>1,800-2,000<br>1,800<br>1,600 | 1,400-1,600<br>1,600-2,000<br>2,000<br>2,000-2,200<br>2,000<br>1,800 | 1,400-1,800<br>1,800-2,200<br>2,400<br>2,400<br>2,200<br>2,200-2,200 |
| Male | 4-8<br>9-13<br>14-18<br>19-30<br>31-50<br>51+ | 1,200-1,400<br>1,600-2,000<br>2,000-2,400<br>2,400-2,600<br>2,200-2,400<br>2,000-2,200 | 1,400-1,600<br>1,800-2,200<br>2,400-2,800<br>2,600-2,800<br>2,400-2,600<br>2,200-2,400 | 1,600-2,000<br>2,000-2,600<br>2,800-3,200<br>3,000<br>2,800-3,000<br>2,400-2,800 |

You can figure out your activity level using this as a guide:

- Sedentary means you only do light physical activity involved with everyday living.
- Moderately active means you do physical activities equal to walking about 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the light activities of daily living.
- Active means you do physical activities equal to walking more than 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the light activities of daily living.

## How Many Calories Should I Eat per Day?

Your daily calorie needs are based on the amount of calories you take in and the number of calories you burn each day. You can get a better estimate of your calories in because each food has an estimated calorie count. It's harder to estimate your calories burned. It's not just the calories you burn through [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/depression/exercise-depression) and daily activities of living, but also how many calories your body burns powering your bodily functions, such as digestion and metabolism.

To get a more exact estimate, you would need to have testing done in a lab to figure out your [basal metabolic rate](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/difference-between-bmr-and-rmr) (BMR), which is how many calories your body burns at rest. Then you could add the calories you burn each day through your activities to get a better picture.

But most people don't have access to lab testing. So you can use these guidelines as a basis for planning your diet:

**How many calories should I eat per day to maintain weight?**

To maintain your current weight, you need to balance the amount of calories you eat and drink with the number of calories your body uses each day. On average, women need about 1,600 to 2,400 calories each day, and men need 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day -- based on age and activity level. If you figure out that you need 2,000 calories per day, then you need to keep your calorie intake about equal with that number.

**How many calories should I eat per day to lose weight?**

When you take in more calories than you burn, your body stores the extra energy it doesn't need as [fat](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-is-visceral-fat). To lose weight, you have to create a [calorie deficit](https://www.webmd.com/diet/calorie-deficit). That means you need to take in fewer calories than you burn each day. This way, your body will dip into your fat stores to meet your energy needs, and you'll lose weight.

**How many calories should I eat per day to gain weight?**

If your goal is to put on pounds, you need to reverse this and eat more calories than your body burns each day.

In reality, weight gain and loss is more complicated than these explanations. Since calorie burning varies so much, the best way to figure out how many calories you need is by watching your results. If you're trying to maintain your weight but you're gaining weight, then you need to lower your calorie intake or increase your calorie burn by being more active.

It's also important to note that your metabolism can be affected by your genetics, health conditions you have, medications you take, and more. If you're having trouble meeting your goals, it helps to see a doctor or dietitian to figure out what is getting in the way of your success.

## How Many Calories Do You Burn a Day Doing Nothing?

Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories you burn each day doing nothing at all. This is the number of calories your body needs to support your body's basic functions, such as breathing, digestion, circulation, and regulating your body [temperature](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/normal-body-temperature). Your BMR makes up about 60% of your daily calorie burn.

BMR is different for each person, depending on things like age, sex, weight, and height. On average:

- Adult women have a BMR of 1,400 to 1,500 calories per day
- Adult men have a BMR of 1,600 to 1,800 calories per day

These are just estimates. It's important to note that how much muscle mass you have strongly affects your BMR. Your body uses much more energy to maintain and build muscle than it does fat. So the more muscle you have, the higher your BMR will be.

**How do you calculate calories burned?**

There are a few ways to calculate calories burned:

**Wear a fitness tracker.** This wearable device will give you an estimate of the calories you burn all day long.

**Wear a heart rate monitor.** Heart rate monitors are usually more accurate than fitness trackers to calculate calorie burn. But they're not as comfortable to wear all day.

**Use a [calorie calculator](https://www.webmd.com/diet/calories-chart).** To measure calories burned during a specific activity, you can use an online tool that takes into account your age, sex, weight, and height, as well as the type of activity you did and how long you did it.

**Use an equation.** You can use the MET (metabolic equivalent of task) value to measure calorie burn from a specific activity. MET values are measured on a scale, with 1 being the least effort and calories burned. You'll need a [MET value chart](https://www.ucdenver.edu/docs/librariesprovider65/clinical-services/sports-medicine/estimating-energy-expenditure.pdf?sfvrsn=eb335bb9_2) to find your MET value for your activity. You'll also need to know your weight in kilograms, which you can figure out by dividing your weight in pounds by 2.2.

Then, you'll put your information into this equation, which will give you the number of calories you burn per minute: 0.0175 x MET value x weight (in kilograms).

For example, if you weigh 60 kilograms (about 132 pounds) and you do low-impact aerobics with a MET value of 5, you'll burn about 5.25 calories per minute. If your class is 45 minutes long, you will have burned just over 236 calories.

## Calorie Counting

Calorie counting is a method of tracking your calories by keeping a record of all the foods and drinks you take in each day. More and more experts no longer recommend calorie counting for a few reasons:

**It's time-consuming.** Keeping track of every calorie you consume takes a lot of time and effort. After a while, it can start to feel like a burden.

**It's not always accurate.** The calorie counts on food labels and in databases can be wrong. You often guess at your portion sizes, which can also cause errors in tracking.

**You might become obsessed and stressed.** Focusing too much numbers can lead to an unhealthy obsession with food and calories, which can cause you [stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-symptoms-effects_of-stress-on-the-body) and [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/anxiety-disorders). It could even lead to an [eating disorder](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/signs-of-eating-disorders).

**It doesn't take food quality into account.** It's possible to stay within your calorie budget eating low-quality foods lacking nutrition.

**It's not a picture of your overall health.** You might spend so much time counting calories that you forget about other important parts of staying healthy and losing weight -- exercise, [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/what-is-sleep-hygiene), lowering stress, and [mental health](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness).

There are still some benefits to keeping track of what you eat:

**It keeps you aware and accountable.** Recording everything you eat and drink, as well as your portion sizes, can make you more mindful.

**Nutrition insight.** You'll have a log of your daily diet that you can review and see where to make healthy changes.

**It helps your doctor or dietitian.** If you're getting help with weight loss from a professional, keeping a food log can give them more information so they can give you better guidance.

It may be better to track what you eat in a day and roughly how much, rather than try to count every single calorie. You can make quick notes about your meals, write down how you felt about the quality -- and how you felt after eating. You can also snap some photos to share with your doctor or dietitian.

## Takeaways

Your daily calorie needs are based on several things, including your sex, age, and activity level. You can get an idea of how many calories you should eat using charts and calculators, but it's hard to figure out an exact amount. In general, if you want to maintain your weight, you should balance the calories you eat with the calories you burn; to lose weight, you should eat fewer calories than you burn; and to gain weight you should eat more calories than you burn. The best way to figure out your calorie needs is to speak with your doctor or a dietitian.

## Calorie FAQs

**What is a calorie in food?**

A calorie is a unit of energy. It measures the amount of energy that food gives to your body. All foods have calories, but some have more than others. Carbohydrates and protein have 4 calories per gram, and fats have 9 calories per gram.

**Which foods are high in calories?**

Because fat has 9 calories per gram, fatty foods have the highest calorie counts. This includes fried foods, fast foods, and snack foods. Nut butters, cheese, and fatty meats are also high in fat. Foods that are high in sugar, such as candy and baked goods, are also high in calories.

**Are all calories created equally?**

No. Some foods offer more nutrition compared to the amount of calories they provide. These nutrient-dense foods include fruits and [vegetables](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-vegetables), whole grains, fish, [lean meats](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/what-to-know-about-lean-beef-cuts), nuts, seeds, and beans. Processed foods like snack foods, baked goods, desserts, candy, and fast foods tend to be low in nutrients and high in calories.

## What Is Cupping Therapy?

[Cupping therapy](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/cupping-therapy) is an ancient form of [alternative medicine](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-alternative-medicine) where a therapist puts special cups on your [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/picture-of-the-skin) for a few minutes to create suction. The idea is to draw blood to or away from parts of your body. People get it for many reasons, such as pain and [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) relief, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits).

The cups may be made of:

- Glass
- Bamboo
- Earthenware
- Silicone
- Plastic

**History of cupping therapy**

[Cupping therapy](https://www.webmd.com/balance/cupping-therapy) might be trendy now, but it’s not new. It dates back to ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern cultures. One of the oldest medical textbooks in the world, the _Ebers Papyrus_ from 1550 B.C., describes how the ancient Egyptians used cupping therapy for treating fever, pain, vertigo, menstrual problems, and other ailments.

The Egyptians introduced cupping to the ancient Greeks who used it as a cure for almost every illness. In traditional Chinese medicine, it's closely linked to acupuncture. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad also recommended cupping in his writings, where he called it _hijama_.

Originally, hollowed-out animal horns were used to treat boils and suck out venom from snake bites. Eventually, horns were replaced by bamboo and then by glass cups.

Cupping was used widely in Europe and America until the 1800s, when it fell out of favor as the practice of medicine became more scientific and focused on treating illnesses from the inside out.

People in several countries still practice cupping. Many Americans first became aware of it after seeing purplish circles on the body of swimmer Michael Phelps during the 2016 Olympics.

## Types of Cupping Therapy

The two main types of cupping are:

- Dry
- Wet

For either type, in the traditional method (fire cupping), your healer puts a flammable substance such as alcohol, herbs, or paper, inside a cup and sets it on fire. As the fire goes out, they put the cup upside down on your [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin).

When the air inside the cup cools, it creates a vacuum. This causes your skin to rise and redden as your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/rm-quiz-blood-basics) vessels expand.

A modern version of cupping uses a rubber pump instead of fire to create a vacuum inside the cup.

**Dry cupping therapy**

Dry cupping is simple and is the preferred method in the West because it's easy to do and doesn't involve blood. The therapist just applies the cups to your skin, compressing them with their hands, a pump, or a flame if using glass cups. (They may apply lotion first). They leave the cups in place for 5-10 minutes. You can have this therapy done as often as once or twice a week.

Dry cupping may be combined with a massage. This is called massage cupping or running cupping. Your therapist puts lotion or oil on your skin and moves silicone cups back and forth, up and down, or in circles on your skin for a [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits)-like effect.

Dry cupping is meant to increase blood flow while removing fluids and toxins from the area being treated. The fluids are said to have high levels of substances related to diseases.

**Wet cupping therapy**

In wet cupping, your therapist first creates a mild suction by leaving a cup on your back for about 3 minutes. They remove the cup and use a small scalpel to make light, tiny cuts on your skin. Next, they do a second suction to draw out a small quantity of [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cm/rm-quiz-blood-basics). They might leave those cups in place for 10-15 minutes.

The idea is the cuts attract inflammatory cells and cause the release of natural pain relievers and mood enhancers called endogenous opioids. These help your body fight infections and maintain immunity.

You might get three to five cups in your first session. Or you might just try one to see how it goes. It’s rare to get more than five to seven cups, the British Cupping Society notes.

After treatment, you'll get an antibiotic ointment and bandage to prevent infection. Your skin should look normal again within 10 days. You can repeat wet cupping every 4-8 weeks.

Wet cupping can also be done in a two-step version where your therapist doesn't start with suction but first makes cuts in the skin and then applies the suction cups.

## Benefits of Cupping Therapy

It's not exactly clear how cupping works to ease pain and cure diseases, though there are several theories. There haven’t been many scientific studies on cupping.

One report, published in 2015 in the _Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine_, notes that it could help with acne, herpes zoster, and pain management. But the researchers said many of the studies they reviewed could have been biased and that better studies were needed.

Cupping therapy is used to treat:

- [Blood disorders](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/blood-disorder-types-and-treatment) such as [anemia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics) and [hemophilia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-hemophilia-basics)
- [Rheumatic diseases](https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/an-overview-of-rheumatic-diseases) such as [arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/default.htm) and [fibromyalgia](https://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/default.htm)
- [Fertility](https://www.webmd.com/baby/ss/slideshow-understanding-fertility-ovulation) and gynecological disorders
- [Skin problems](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/default.htm) such as [eczema](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/atopic-dermatitis-eczema) and [acne](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/ss/slideshow-acne-dictionary)
- Back pain and other types of body pain
- [High blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm)
- [Migraine](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-migraines) s
- [Anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/default.htm) and [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/what-is-depression)
- Bronchial congestion caused by [allergies and asthma](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/allergies-asthma)
- [Varicose veins](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-varicose-veins-basics)

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health says there's not enough high-quality research to determine whether cupping can be used for all these conditions.

**Cupping for pain management**

The "pain-gate" theory says that the touch and pressure from cupping stimulate large nerve fibers, which results in the blocking of pain signals to the brain sent by other nerves. The gate control system is in our spinal cords. So, activating these nerve fibers can block pain transmission.

Does it work? One 2023 review of existing studies found that cupping seemed effective for managing chronic pain, knee osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain, chronic back pain, and herpes zoster. But the studies were all of low to moderate quality. In general, experts see cupping as something that should complement conventional medicine rather than replace it.

**Cupping for acne**

In the immune system theory, cupping can reduce inflammatory substances and increase the production of substances to improve your immune system. Cupping may also boost your body's antioxidant processes. So, cupping might be able to help with skin conditions. One Iranian study compared two groups of people. One got acne medicine along with wet cupping, while the other got acne medicine and "sham cupping" (a device that felt like real cupping but had a tiny hole). The group that got the medicine and the wet cupping showed more improvement than the control group.

**Cupping with acupuncture**

Some people get "needle cupping," where the therapist first inserts [acupuncture](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/consider-acupuncture) needles and then puts cups over them. The idea is that the cupping loosens muscles while the needles relieve the pain. One study showed that ear acupuncture combined with cupping therapy was more effective in treating chronic back pain than treatment using only ear acupuncture.

## Cupping Therapy Side Effects

Cupping is fairly safe, as long as you go to a trained professional. But you could have the following side effects in the area(s) where the cups touch your skin:

- Mild discomfort
- Burns
- [Bruises](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/bruises-article)
- Skin infection

If the cups and equipment become contaminated with blood and aren't sterilized correctly between patients, bloodborne diseases such as hepatitis B and C can be spread.

**Burns from cupping**

Burns from fire cupping are a hazard but seem to be rare. Overheating the cup is usually the problem. An Australian study looked at 18,703 patients enrolled in the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand over a 7-year period and found just 20 had cupping-associated burn injuries. Sixteen of these occurred at home. Still, more people could have been burned but not badly enough to go to a hospital. There have been some other reports of people getting burned at cupping clinics.

**Marks from cupping**

Cupping marks are a common side effect of applying suction cups to your skin. They're usually circular and can range in color from light pink to dark purple, depending on your skin tone and how much pressure was used to apply the cups. These usually fade over time, in about 1-10 days.

If you have to go to your doctor before the bruises have healed, let them know that the marks aren't due to physical abuse.

**Can cupping therapy cause blood clots?**

There's no conclusive evidence, but some believe it's a risk. Experts warn to avoid cupping if your skin is scraped, oozing, or infected, as this can increase the chance of blood clotting. Also, if you're on a blood thinner or have heart disease, you shouldn't do cupping therapy.

## Cupping Points

You can have cupping on any part of your skin where suction cups can be applied. The most common areas are the:

- Back
- Chest
- Stomach
- Buttocks

These all have a lot of muscle. Less common areas include the chin, the crown of the head, thighs, neck, and shoulders.

**Cupping therapy for shoulders**

Cupping could be good for shoulder pain, as it increases circulation in the pain area (which encourages healing) and reduces muscle tension. But there aren't definitive studies that say cupping reduces shoulder pain.

**Benefits of cupping therapy on back**

Back pain is a popular reason why people seek out cupping. The theory is the same as for shoulder pain -- cupping increases blood circulation and reduces muscle tension. Some studies do show it can reduce back pain, but they aren't conclusive.

**Benefits of cupping on knees**

Cupping may reduce knee inflammation by increasing blood flow and flexibility. It also encourages tissue repair. One study said cupping for knee osteoarthritis was as effective as taking 650 milligrams of acetaminophen three times a day. But other studies showed weak evidence.

## Who Does Cupping Therapy?

Many people may offer cupping therapy, including:

- Massage therapists
- Acupuncturists
- Physical therapists
- Chiropractors
- Occupational Therapists
- Doctors

You're most likely to get cupping from a massage therapist or an acupuncturist. They don't need to have special certification to offer cupping therapy, but they often have it. They usually need to be a licensed massage therapist or acupuncturist to offer any services. Requirements depend on the state you live in.

Make sure that your provider/therapist is cleaning and sterilizing the equipment they use between sessions, or using disposable cups and blades.

**Cost of cupping therapy**

Costs run about $30-$100 per session, depending on where you live and how long your session lasts. It could be as short as 15 minutes or as long as 1 hour. Also, wet cupping will cost more than the dry type. Some places offer a discount if you buy a package of appointments.

**Cupping therapy at home**

Yes, you can give yourself cupping therapy. Many kits are available containing plastic, silicone, or glass cups. Please _do not_ buy glass cups, as these need to be heated to be applied and are too dangerous for beginners to use. Stick with plastic or silicone. Plastic ones usually come with a pump. Silicone cups are for doing massage cupping, which involves moving the cups around.

You can learn how to use cups by reading books, watching videos, or following instructions online. Let your doctor know you intend to try this therapy, as you might have a health problem that could make cupping a bad idea.

## What to Ask Your Doctor First

Talk with your doctor before you start cupping or any other type of complementary medicine. Talk extensively with your cupping therapist before you try it. Ask:

- What conditions do you use cupping for?
- What is your training?
- What is your experience in using it?
- Are there reasons I shouldn't get cupping?

You should probably avoid cupping if you have:

- Cancer
- Organ failure
- Hemophilia or other blood clotting disease
- A pacemaker
- Cardiovascular disease
- High cholesterol
- An infection

You should also avoid cupping if you're pregnant, menstruating, elderly, under 18, or taking a blood thinner.

## Takeaways

Cupping is an ancient therapy that's now back in style. It aims to increase blood flow, soften scar tissue, and decrease muscle pain by placing suction cups on your body and leaving them on for 10-15 minutes. Practitioners say it can help with back pain, arthritis, depression, migraines, acne, and many other conditions. Not many scientific studies support these claims, but some people who've had cupping therapy done swear by it.

## Cupping Therapy FAQs

**Is cupping good or not?**

Some studies say that cupping helps with pain relief, but most of the studies were not high-quality. Scientists aren't exactly sure how cupping works, so more research is needed. Cupping has minor side effects, so trying it usually won't hurt. Just let your doctor know you want to do it. And don't stop your normal treatment unless your doctor says it's OK.

**What to expect after cupping?**

After a cupping session, you'll probably see round red marks on your skin, which should fade in a week or two. Your therapist may advise you to drink lots of water (to flush out toxins), stay warm, and rest. You may feel a little tired as if you're fighting a minor illness. Therapists say this is normal, a side effect of your body getting rid of toxins.

## REM Sleep vs. Non-REM Sleep

A lot happens in your body while you sleep. When you get your ZZZs, you go back and forth between REM and non-REM sleep.

REM stands for [rapid eye movement](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101). During REM sleep, your eyes move around rapidly in different directions, and your brain is active. Your brain activity is similar to its activity when you’re awake. [Dreams](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/dreaming-overview) typically happen during REM [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/what-is-sleep-hygiene).

During non-REM sleep, your brain is not as active. And in the deeper stages of non-REM sleep, your breathing slows down, and your blood pressure drops.

After you fall asleep, non-REM sleep comes first, followed by a shorter period of REM [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/ss/slideshow-sleep-disorders-overview), and then the cycle starts over again.

![Sleep Stages and Your Body infographic](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/BigBead/what_are_rem_and_non_rem_sleep_bigbead/650x970_what_are_rem_and_non_rem_sleep_bigbead.jpg)

## Stages of Sleep

When you sleep, you go through cycles that last between 90 and 120 minutes. Each cycle includes three stages of non-REM (NREM) sleep and a stage of REM sleep.

Here are the three stages of NREM sleep. You go through all three of them before you get to REM sleep.

Stage 1. Your eyes are closed, but it's easy to wake you up. This phase may last for 5 to 10 minutes.

Stage 2. You are in light sleep, but it’s deeper than stage 1. Your heart rate and breathing slow down, and your body temperature drops. Your body is getting ready for deep sleep. This can last for 10-25 minutes.

Stage 3. This is the deep sleep stage. It's harder to rouse you during this stage, and if someone woke you up, you would feel disoriented for a few minutes. In adults, stage 3 makes up about 25% of total sleep time.

During the deep stages of NREM sleep, the body repairs and regrows tissues, builds bone and muscle, and strengthens your immune system.

As you get older, you sleep more lightly and get less deep sleep. Aging is also linked to shorter periods of sleep, although studies show you still need as much sleep as you did when you were younger.

After NREM sleep, you move into the REM stage. After REM sleep, you start another cycle. If you get 8 hours of sleep each night, you usually go through four or five cycles.

## What Is REM Sleep?

Usually, REM sleep happens 90 minutes after you fall asleep. The first period of REM typically lasts 10 minutes. Each of your later REM stages gets longer, and the final one may last up to an hour. Your heart rate and breathing quicken.

Your muscles usually go limp so that you don’t act out your dreams. You can have intense [dreams](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/cm/rm-quiz-dreams) during REM sleep since your brain is more active.

REM is important because it stimulates the areas of your brain that help with learning and memory. During this stage, your brain repairs itself and processes emotional experiences. It also transfers short-term memories into long-term memories.

## Lack of REM Sleep Symptoms

If you don’t get enough REM sleep, here are some symptoms you may have:

- Trouble coping with emotions
- Trouble concentrating
- A weakened immune system
- Feeling groggy in the morning

If you have these symptoms, you may want to try to increase your REM sleep.

## How to Increase REM Sleep

To increase your REM sleep, you need to get more sleep overall. Here are some ways to improve your sleep and get more sleep:

- Create a relaxing bedtime routine to help you wind down each night.
- Set a sleep schedule and stick to it. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day.
- Avoid nicotine and caffeine.
- Exercise and spend some time outside in natural sunlight every day.
- Avoid alcohol and meals close to bedtime.
- Avoid TV and electronics before bed because the light from these screens can interfere with your sleep.

## Too Much REM Sleep

Sometimes, you may spend more sleep time than usual in the REM stage. Your REM sleep can be more frequent, deeper, and more intense. This is called REM rebound, and it can happen if you’ve been sleep deprived, meaning you’ve been getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night. Also, if you’ve been dealing with significant stress or drug withdrawal, that can lead to REM rebound. It’s your body’s way of trying to restore balance in your sleep cycle.

Signs of REM rebound include:

- Especially vivid dreams or nightmares
- Feeling disoriented or confused when you wake up
- Headaches

Usually, REM rebound sleep will decrease if you improve your overall sleep.

## How Much Deep Sleep Do You Need?

The amount of time you spend in each stage of a sleep cycle can change during each night, but also over your lifetime. For example, babies spend a lot of time in the REM stage, up to 50% of their sleep. Adults spend only about 20% in REM.

Stage 3 of NREM sleep is the deep sleep stage. Children get the most deep sleep, and teenagers get less of it. The amount of deep sleep you get as an adult continues to decrease as you get older. You typically spend about 25% of your sleeping time in stage 3, but this amount decreases with age.

Overall, the amount of sleep people need depends on their age. Here’s how much sleep you should get daily:

- Babies up to 12 months old: 12 to 17 hours (including naps)
- Children up to 5 years old: 10 to 14 hours (including naps)
- Children between 6 and 12 years old: 9 to 12 hours
- Teenagers: 8 to 10 hours
- Adults: 7 to 9 hours

If you’re an adult getting 8 hours of sleep each night, spending 25% of it in stage 3 would mean you spend about 2 hours in deep sleep.

## Takeaways

Each time you go to sleep, you start a new sleep cycle that goes from non-REM stages to a REM stage. The REM stage is usually when you dream, and your deepest sleep happens during non-REM sleep. Both REM sleep and non-REM sleep are important because while you’re asleep, your brain and body are busy repairing and strengthening things as well as processing memories. If you don’t get enough sleep, it can affect your physical and mental health and your overall well-being.

## REM FAQs

**Which is better, REM or non-REM sleep?** You need both REM and non-REM sleep. REM sleep is important for your learning and memory, and non-REM sleep is when your body repairs and regrows tissues.

**What is the main difference between NREM and REM sleep?** During REM sleep, your eyes move rapidly and your brain is active. Deeper sleep happens during NREM sleep, when your heart rate and body temperature decrease.

**Is REM sleep good for you?** Yes. REM sleep is important for your learning and memory, and it helps you concentrate and regulate your mood.

**What is non-REM sleep good for?** Non-REM sleep is when your body repairs and regrows tissues and builds bone and muscle. Non-REM sleep also helps strengthen your immune system.

**What does REM sleep cycle mean?** Every night, you go through sleep cycles, and each cycle includes a REM stage and three non-REM stages. If you sleep for 8 hours per night, you may go through four to five sleep cycles.

## What Is Dizziness?

Dizziness is a feeling of being lightheaded, unsteady, and faint. It can make you feel like the world is spinning. Sometimes the feeling is mild and goes away quickly. Other times it can be severe and come along with other symptoms, like a headache and throwing up.

## Dizziness Causes

Many parts of your body – including your eyes, brain, inner ear, and nerves in your feet and spine – work together to keep you balanced. When a part of that system is off, you can feel dizzy.

Many things can cause dizziness, such as:

- Inner ear problems, like [vertigo](https://www.webmd.com/brain/vertigo-symptoms-causes-treatment)
- Inner ear infections
- Being low in certain nutrients
- Heart problems
- Concussion
- Diseases that affect your brain
- Dehydration
- Stress and anxiety
- Some medications
- [Motion sickness](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ear-infection/motion-sickness)
- Low blood sugar

## Vertigo

If it feels like the room is spinning around you and you have trouble staying steady on your feet, you might have a type of dizziness called vertigo. Vertigo can be a symptom of several health conditions affecting your inner ear and your vestibular system. The vestibular system is what helps you sense your body's position in space, coordinate your movements, and stay upright and balanced.

**Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo**

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common inner ear disorder. With [BPPV](https://www.webmd.com/brain/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo), tiny bits of calcium in part of your inner ear get loose and move to places they don't belong. The system doesn't work the way it should and sends your brain the wrong signals.

It's often caused by the natural breakdown of cells that happens with age. A head injury can cause it, too.

You'll feel it briefly when you tilt or turn your head, and especially when you roll over in bed or sit up. BPPV isn't serious and usually goes away on its own. If not – or you'd like to help it along – it can be treated with special head exercises to get the pieces of calcium back in place. Your doctor can help you perform these exercises.

**Meniere's disease**

People with Meniere'sdisease have too much fluid in their inner ear. This condition brings on intense periods of vertigo that can last hours. You may feel fullness or pressure in one ear. Other symptoms include ringing in your ears, hearing loss, and nausea. You may feel exhausted after the attack passes.

Doctors don't know what causes it, and there's no cure for it. It's usually treated with diet changes (a low-salt diet) and medicine to control the dizziness.

**Inner ear infection**

Inflammation of the nerves in your ears due to infection also causes vertigo. Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis are two types of infections that can cause problems in the inner ear. Vestibular neuritis affects your vestibular nerve, and [labyrinthitis](https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-labyrinthitis) affects both your vestibular nerve and your cochlear nerve – a nerve in your ear involved in hearing. These infections are often caused by a virus.

**Other causes of vertigo**

Some other causes of vertigo include:

- A noncancerous tumor that puts pressure on the vestibular nerve called an acoustic neuroma
- Some medications that hurt the inner ear, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, diuretics, or salicylates
- Head injury
- Stroke
- Multiple sclerosis
- Vestibular migraine

## Heart Problems and Dizziness

Dizziness can sometimes be a sign of a heart problem. It could be an early sign of heart disease or a more serious sign of a heart attack.

If your arteries are blocked because of [atherosclerosis](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/atherosclerosis-whats-your-personal-risk), for example, your blood flow slows down and doesn’t circulate through your body as it should. Your heart tries to pump harder and faster to help. This might make you feel a racing heart and dizziness, as well as other symptoms.

**Heart palpitations and dizziness**

Heart palpitations – the feeling that your heart is beating faster than normal or fluttering – is fairly common. But if you feel your heart fluttering and dizziness together, this could be a sign of problems with your heart. You should see your doctor as soon as possible if this happens.

## Low Blood Pressure and Dizziness

Dizziness can be a sign of low blood pressure, or hypotension. Your brain needs a steady supply of oxygen-rich blood to function properly. Your heart provides this by pumping the blood throughout your body.

This pumping action causes pressure as it pushes the blood through the arteries. This is similar to when you turn on a garden hose. As the water fills the hose, it puts pressure on the hose itself. If the water pressure is too low, the water can’t reach as far.

If your blood pressure drops too low, the blood doesn’t circulate and can’t reach your brain. This can cause dizziness and fainting, especially if you move suddenly from a sitting to a standing position.

Other heart- and circulation-related problems can cause dizziness, such as:

- Heart attack
- Sudden severe blood loss
- Standing up quickly, particularly for older people
- Blood clots
- Clogged arteries
- [Irregular heartbeat](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/what-causes-heart-palpitations)

## Other Common Causes of Dizziness

Dizziness is quite common and has a wide range of other causes.

**Dehydration**

Many people don't drink enough fluids to replace the liquid they lose every day when they sweat, breathe, and pee.

When you're very dehydrated, your blood pressure can drop, your brain may not get enough oxygen, and you'll feel dizzy. Other symptoms of [dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults) include thirstiness, tiredness, and dark urine.

To help avoid dehydration, drink plenty of water and other unsweetened beverages, and limit coffee, tea, and soda, which can increase dehydration.

**Medications**

Several drugs list dizziness as a possible side effect. Check with your doctor if you take:

- Antibiotics, including gentamicin and streptomycin
- Antidepressants
- Anti-seizure medications
- Blood pressure medicine
- Sedatives

**Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)**

People with diabetes need to check the amount of sugar (glucose) in their blood often. You can get dizzy if it drops too low. That also can cause hunger, shakiness, [sweating](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/sweating-assessment/default-old), and confusion. Some people without diabetes also have trouble with low blood sugar.

**Motion sickness**

If you get motion sickness, either from riding in a car, being on a boat, or even going on a carnival ride, you may get dizzy as well as sick to your stomach.

**Concussions (traumatic brain injuries)**

If you’ve had a strong impact to your head, you are at risk of a concussion – a traumatic brain injury (TBI). A blow to the head could be caused by many things, such as a fall down stairs, certain sports (especially sports like football), or even if your head and neck are shaken badly, like in a car accident.

One of the signs of a concussion is dizziness. You could also have:

- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting
- Ringing in your ears
- Blurry vision
- Drowsiness
- Confusion

Concussions should be taken seriously. If you think you might have one, seek emergency care as soon as possible.

**Anxiety and stress**

If you are anxious, you could feel several physical symptoms, including dizziness. Doctors don’t know why this happens, but they think that somehow the areas in the brain responsible for anxiety and dizziness interact with each other, and that interaction results in dizziness.

**Carbon monoxide poisoning**

[Carbon monoxide poisoning](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/carbon-monoxide-poisoning) is very serious. Every year, more than 100,000 people in the U.S. need emergency treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning, and at least 420 die. One of the most common symptoms is dizziness, along with:

- Headache
- Weakness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Chest pain
- Confusion

If you have any of these symptoms, leave where you are right away and call 911.

**Low iron levels**

Iron is an essential mineral that helps your blood carry oxygen throughout your body. Low iron levels, called iron deficiency [anemia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics), can cause dizziness, as well as:

- Fatigue
- Feeling that your hands and feet are cold
- Weakness
- Shortness of breath
- A hard time concentrating
- Bruising easily
- Headaches

There are many reasons you could be low in iron, including:

- Internal bleeding, like in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract or urinary tract
- Losing blood after a serious injury or during surgery
- Having heavy menstrual periods
- Blood loss after childbirth or miscarriage
- Giving blood donations too frequently
- Certain diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis)
- Weight loss surgery
- [Kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information)

## Dizziness Symptoms

Feeling dizzy can be very uncomfortable. Symptoms include feeling like:

- Everything around you is moving or spinning and you’re not.
- You’re lightheaded and going to faint.
- You can’t keep your balance.
- You're a little confused or foggy.
- You're nauseated.

## How to Stop Feeling Dizzy

Occasional dizziness often goes away on its own. In general, if you feel dizzy, try lying down for a few minutes. Sit up very slowly, without sudden movements. Then slowly stand up. This may help.

Here are some more tips and home remedies for dizziness, depending on what caused it:

**Dehydration.** If you are overheated or dehydrated, drink fluids, move to a cool or shaded spot, and rest. Water is good, but you may want to try a sports drink, which has electrolytes and minerals the can speed hydration.

**Medications.** Check your drugs for side effects to see if they could be causing your dizziness. Speak with your doctor or pharmacist about your dizziness. If it’s caused by an over-the-counter medication, the pharmacist may be able to suggest another type. If it’s a prescription medication, there may be tips on when and how to take the drug to lower the risk of dizziness. If not, then speak with your doctor to see if there is another medication that can replace it.

**Low blood sugar.** A quick fix is to eat or drink something with sugar, like juice or a hard candy. But if you have [diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-symptoms), speak with your doctor about the best way to handle low blood sugar.

**Motion sickness.** It’s not always possible to avoid motion sickness. If you do get motion sickness, you can:

- Sit in the front seat of a car or as close to the front as possible in a bus. Look out at the horizon.
- Choose window seats when possible.
- Lie down if you’re on a boat.
- Close your eyes.
- Sip water to stay hydrated.
- Eat small portions of food frequently.
- Don't smoke.
- Suck on ginger candy or other types of lozenges.

If your dizziness is caused by something more serious, like a concussion, illness, or an injury, you need to see a doctor. You may need treatment for what is causing it, like antibiotics for an ear infection.

## Takeaways

It’s not unusual to feel dizzy once in a while, especially if it’s caused by motion sickness or being out in the sun for too long. But if you have frequent episodes, the dizziness doesn’t go away, or it’s interfering with your daily activities, speak to your doctor so you can find out what is causing it.

If you are dizzy after hitting your head, no matter how lightly, or you have any of these symptoms along with the dizziness, get emergency medical care. Do not drive yourself to the hospital, though, because the dizziness could cause you to have an accident.

- A hard time breathing
- Chest pain
- Irregular heartbeat
- Numbness or weakness of your arms, legs, or face
- A hard time walking
- A hard time speaking or slurred speech
- [Double vision](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/double-vision-diplopia-causes-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment)
- Severe headache
- Confusion
- Seizures
- A hard time hearing
- Continuous vomiting

## Dizziness FAQs

**When should you worry about dizziness?**

If you get dizzy once in a while and it goes away, you probably don’t need to worry. But if you get dizzy a lot and if the dizziness lasts for long periods, it could be caused by a more serious problem, like an ear infection or medication side effect. Dizziness after a head injury is an emergency, so seek help right away if this happens.

**What are the causes of dizziness?**

There are many possible causes of dizziness, from simple things like spinning too much on a carnival ride to motion sickness. But there are some serious causes as well, such as a head injury, blood loss, or having low blood sugar levels.

**What are the red flags for dizziness?**

You should be concerned about being dizzy if it happens after a head injury, it happens often, lasts long, or you have other symptoms as well. These include having a sudden, severe headache, confusion, double vision, or numbness or weakness in your arms, legs, or face, among others.

**How do I stop feeling dizzy?**

Try lying down for a few minutes and closing your eyes. Then sit up slowly, taking your time. Finally, stand up slowly – don’t make sudden or quick movements.

Water doesn't get the same media attention as green tea, [antioxidants](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/how-antioxidants-work1), and the latest [fad diets](https://www.webmd.com/diet/the-truth-about-fad-diets). Yet it plays a much more critical part in our daily lives and our bodies.

Our bodies are made up of about 60% water, and every system depends on water. So water is important for healthy skin, [hair](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics), and nails, as well as controlling [body temperature](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/normal-body-temperature), [heart rate](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/watching-rate-monitor), and [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers).

"It's definitely essential," says Jim White, registered dietitian and personal trainer in Virginia Beach, Va., and American Dietetic Association spokesman.

"What we're finding is so many people are deficient," he notes. "We're seeing a huge decrease in athletic performance and [fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/women/why-so-tired-10-causes-fatigue) that's caused by the lack of [hydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults)."

You can stay fully hydrated throughout the day by drinking water and other fluids, as well as eating foods that are hydrating.

## What Counts as Water?

Fruits are an excellent source for water. Watermelon is 90% water, so it ranks highest on the list. Oranges, grapefruit, and melons like cantaloupe and honeydew are also strong contenders.

Vegetables, though not as full of water as fruit, can also provide a nutrient-rich water source. Stick with celery, cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers, and Romaine lettuce.

There are plenty of hidden sources of water in your diet, says White. If you want to tap into these foods, reach for oatmeal, yogurt, soup, and smoothies.

Besides guzzling water, milk is a top choice to refuel. Juices and sports drinks are also hydrating -- you can lower the sugar content by diluting them with water.

Coffee and tea also count in your tally. Many used to believe that they were dehydrating, but that myth has been debunked. The diuretic effect does not offset [hydration](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/cm/rm-quiz-know-about-hydration).

Alcohol is a huge dehydrator, says White. You should try to limit your intake, but if you are going to raise a glass, aim for at least a one-to-one ratio with water.

If you don't like the taste of plain water, White suggests adding lemon to it. Or test out your own concoction, like sparkling water with raspberries with a sprig of mint.

## How Much Water Should I Drink?

Parents should make sure that children and teens are getting adequate hydration throughout the day. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children drink plenty of fluids before starting any [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-7-most-effective-exercises) and continue to drink during physical activity.

During exercise, the AAP suggests drinking about 4-8 ounces of water every 20 minutes for children 9-12, and about 12-16 ounces every 20 minutes for adolescent boys and girls.

Athletes need to take precautions to avoid [dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/children/video/summer-hydration-tips). White recommends drinking 16 ounces one hour prior to exercise, 4-8 ounces every 15 minutes during exercise, and another 16 ounces an hour after exercise. The amounts can vary depending on your personal response, heat index, and the type of activity.

"If you're [sweating](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hyperhidrosis2), you're losing water," says Nancy Clark, MS, RD, sports dietitian in Chestnut Hill, Mass., and author of _Nancy Clark's Sports_ _Nutrition_ _Guidebook._

How can you tell if you're getting enough fluids during the day? You can tell by checking your urine color and output. If you're urinating every two to four hours, the output is light-colored, and there's significant volume, then you're probably well-hydrated.

"That's a very simple, easy way to monitor hydration," says Clark. "If you go from 8 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon without peeing, then you're dehydrated."

## Signs of Dehydration

How can you tell if you're dehydrated? You might feel tired, cranky, moody, or get a headache. "As the body gets dehydrated, the [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/high-cholesterol-healthy-heart) has to work harder to pump [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) through the vessels," explains Clark.

To get a better handle on your hydration levels, White recommends keeping a water log. "Everyone tracks food. How often do we track our water intake?" he asks.

For techie types, there are free apps that pop up with water reminders throughout the day. Whatever method works best for you, drink up and stay well hydrated.

If you have [type 2 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes) or are at a high risk for it, you might have heard claims that honey may be better for you than other [sweeteners](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/default.htm). But while honey may have some health benefits, it’s still a source of simple [sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-sugar-addiction) and carbohydrates. And if you have [diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm), you need to count your carbohydrates throughout the day, especially if you’re using [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) like [insulin](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-types-insulin). Here’s what you need to know before you decide how you should handle honey in your [diet](https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm).

## Is Honey Different From Other Sweeteners?

Honey is a sweetener. It’s also called an “added [sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diet/cm/rm-quiz-sugars-sweeteners)” on [food labels](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-labels-expert) because it isn’t naturally part of other foods. Instead, you add it to food in order to sweeten them. Honey is a source of carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates mostly come from glucose and fructose, which are simple sugars.

Per tablespoon, honey has:

- 64 calories
- 17 grams of sugar
- 17 grams of carbohydrates
- 0.06 grams of [protein](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/good-protein-sources)
- 0.04 grams of fiber

It also contains [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/diet/vitamin-supplement-glossary) and [minerals](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/guide/vitamins-and-minerals-good-food-sources) like [potassium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-potassium), [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1575/calcium+oral/details), zinc, and [vitamin C](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1001-vitamin+c+ascorbic+acid.aspx?activeingredientid=1001&activeingredientname=vitamin+c+(ascorbic+acid)), and [antioxidants](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/antioxidants-your-immune-system-super-foods-optimal-health). But not in amounts that are significant, so don’t look to honey as a major source of these nutrients.

Honey is different from white or “table” sugar because sugar doesn’t have any vitamins and minerals. Honey has a lower [glycemic index](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/glycemic-index-good-versus-bad-carbs) (GI) than sugar, too. The glycemic index measures how quickly a [carbohydrate](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/default.htm) raises [blood sugar levels](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes). Honey has a GI score of 58, and sugar has a GI value of 60. That means honey (like all carbohydrates) raises [blood sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes) quickly, but not quite as fast as sugar. Still, it’s not a big difference.

There’s not likely to be a benefit to swapping sugar for honey if you have diabetes, since they affect your blood sugar in similar ways. If you do choose to eat honey, make sure you know how much you’re getting. Foods that have honey in their name or sauce may contain more honey and carbohydrates than you realize. That can negatively affect your blood sugar and your ability to take the right amount of insulin.

## Can You Eat Honey if You Have Diabetes?

Experts used to recommend that people with diabetes avoid all foods with added sugar. Now some say it’s OK to eat them in small amounts as part of a healthy diet. But if you take insulin, it’s very important to count the number of carbohydrates (including honey) that you take each day. That helps you determine the correct dose of insulin you should take.

Staying on top of the number of carbohydrates and fiber you eat can also help you keep your blood sugar from going too high. Even if you take insulin, high [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) sugar can lead to health problems over time. That’s why it’s a good idea to limit honey. Talk to your diabetes educator, doctor, or a dietitian who specializes in diabetes to figure out how much is safe for you.

## Is Honey Good for Diabetes?

Experts don’t all agree on whether honey is a good choice for people with diabetes. Research shows that honey has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities. That may be important for people with diabetes, who often have higher levels of [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) in their bodies. But many foods deliver antioxidants without driving up your blood sugar. So you definitely don’t need honey to get those nutrients. You have other options that would be better for you.

Much of the research on diabetes and honey has been done on lab animals. But some studies have been done with people, too.

One study from Turkish researchers found that people with [type 2 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/cm/rm-quiz-type-2-diabetes) who ate 5-25 grams of honey daily for 4 months reduced their hemoglobin A1c ( [HbA1c](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/glycated-hemoglobin-test-hba1c)), which is a measure of blood sugar control over recent months. But those who had more honey each day saw their A1c level rise. And with only 64 people in the study -- half of whom got honey doses daily -- it’s hard to know whether the results apply more broadly.

Another study found that eating honey daily increased A1c levels. That study included 48 people with [type 2 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/ss/slideshow-type-2-diabetes-overview), half of whom got a dose of honey for 8 weeks.

A 2016 study from Egyptian researchers also found that people with [type 2 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/video/kahn-why-type-2-diabetes-dangerous) increased their blood sugar.

Because the tests on honey and diabetes have had mixed results at best and included small groups of people, more research is needed to know what, if any, amount of honey is safest for people with diabetes.

The problem begins with some scratching here and there. Maybe you spot some tiny specks around the house that you might’ve missed before. Maybe your pet's beautiful hair that was so thick is looking a tad thin these days. Before you know it … yep. It’s confirmed.

Fido has fleas. And you’d better check Fluffy the cat, too.

More than 2,000 species of fleas exist throughout the world, yet one is the most common among American dogs and cats. It’s called _Ctenocephalides felis_, or the cat flea.

That’s right. If your dog has fleas, they’re most likely cat fleas. So, what are they like?

## What Are Fleas?

[Fleas](https://www.webmd.com/pets/flea-pest-problems) are tiny wingless parasites that survive by sucking on animal or human blood. They find new hosts to live on by searching for body heat, movements, and breathing. (Fleas usually can't see well.) Once fleas detect a new host, they jump onto its skin, fur, or feathers.

A couple of [fleas on your dog](https://www.webmd.com/pets/remove-fleas-from-pet) can morph into many more. After sucking some of your dog's blood, adult fleas will mate and lay eggs in its fur. These eggs often fall off your dog as it moves around. Once these eggs hatch into larvae, they find a place (say, a crack in a dog bed) to crawl into and make a cocoon. In a few weeks, they become adult fleas looking for hosts to jump onto, to eat blood, and to lay more eggs.

## Where Do Fleas Come From?

Outdoors, fleas like warm, humid places to wait for hosts. They'll live in trees, shrubs, and tall grass. Urban wildlife like raccoons, foxes, and squirrels may have fleas, and your dog may be drawn to places where these animals live. Fleas might also gather in kennels or by a spot on the porch your dog likes.

Indoors, fleas like places where your pet might sleep or rest, like your carpets or a dog bed.

Fleas can remain inactive for a long time, waiting for the weather to warm up or the right host to pass by.

## What Do Fleas Look Like?

Fleas are about 1/8 to 1/12 of an inch long, wingless, and brown or black in color. They have hard bodies, large hind legs, and look flat. This body type allows them to move easily between the fur or feathers on their animal host. Fleas also have piercing mouth parts for sucking blood and flexible spines that lock into animal fur, making it difficult to pull them off.

**Do fleas fly?**

Fleas don't fly. Instead, they are amazing jumpers. They can jump up to 7 inches high and up to 13 inches across a flat surface. That's about 200 times their body length!

## Flea Life Cycle

A flea life cycle takes between 2 weeks and 8 months, depending on the temperature, their access to food, and the type of flea. They prefer a temperature of 70 to 85 F and a humidity of 70%. There are four stages in the flea life cycle.

1. **Eggs.** A female flea lays 15 to 50 eggs per day on her host's fur. These often fall out while your pet is sleeping or walking. These eggs are white, smooth, and oval-shaped, about 1/50th of an inch long.
2. **Larvae.** In 2 to 14 days, the eggs hatch into larvae that look like tiny clear maggots. The larval stage can last 1 week to several months. Flea larvae will eat dandruff and skin flakes but also blood and feces (poop) given to them by adult fleas. The adult fleas poop out excess dried blood in tiny pellets, called "flea dirt." Eating the flea dirt turns the larvae from a clear color to nearly purple. Although blind and legless, they move quite fast and will live in floor cracks or under pet beds and carpets as they mature.
3. **Pupae**. Hidden from view, the larva spins a white silken cocoon and molts into a pupa. This may take 7 to 10 days, but adult fleas may stay as pupae for months if it's winter. Once the weather turns warm and humid, they'll emerge as adult fleas ready to leave their cocoons.
4. **Adult fleas**. Warm weather and the presence of an animal will encourage adult fleas to emerge from their cocoons and jump onto a host. A newly emerged flea can live up to a week without having a blood meal. Under ideal conditions, a flea can live up to 18 months, but a more normal life cycle is 2 or 3 months.

## Flea Infestation

Although it may be tough, you can see signs of a flea infestation in your home. Look for tiny black dots (flea dirt) on your pets, furniture, rugs, carpets, or pet bedding.

Also, check whether your pet is constantly scratching itself. That's a good sign that it may have fleas.

## Signs of Fleas

If you have a pet, it's wise to know the signs that it may have a flea problem. They include:

**Your dog (or cat) is scratching**

Even if you don’t catch fleas red-handed, if you see your pet scratching or biting at its fur, fleas may well be the culprit.

**You can see them**

Adult fleas are tiny, about 1/8 of an inch long. They're hard to see without a microscope (though it’s easier on light-colored fur), but they do have big back legs. For every flea you do see, there may be at least 100 younger ones that you don't.

**You can see what they leave behind**

It’s called flea dirt, and it looks like pepper. You can spot it on your pet’s skin, or your pet could leave it someplace, like:

- Its bedding
- The carpet
- That favorite chair it's been sleeping on, even though you’ve shooed it off a thousand times

**You can see their eggs around your home**

These tiny white ovals will likely fall off your pet and onto your furniture, the dog bed, or your carpet, only to hatch a few days later into flea larvae. The eggs might be hard to see due to their tiny size.

**You see tapeworms**

These internal parasites look like small pieces of rice. They often slip out of your pet’s rectum (where poop comes out).

**Your dog (or cat) is losing its hair**

It’s not from the fleas themselves, but from all the itching and biting. Fleas often gather at the neck and shoulder blades of animals, and they bite or scratch their fur to get at the insects. The base of the tail and the backs of legs are favorite hangouts for fleas, too. And you may see them in the bare areas of your pet’s belly.

**Their skin looks irritated**

If you can get past your pet’s fur and look at the skin, flea bites are usually small, raised red dots. Again, look for bites on the back and neck and on the base of the tail.

**Their gums are pale**

Some pets with fleas (especially smaller kittens or pups) could get anemia, or a loss of red blood cells. Fleas can take in up to 15 times their body weight in blood. Pale gums often signal anemia.

**Fleas on dogs**

You can know if your dog has fleas if it starts scratching and biting its fur. Also look for missing hair on the tail base and backs of the legs. Although you may see fleas or [flea bites](https://www.webmd.com/pets/flea-bites-protect-yourself) on your dogs, flea eggs are harder to find, as they're microscopic, white, and may look like dry skin or sand. It's easier to spot flea eggs in your pet's bedding. You may see flea dirt there as well. Look for a salt-and-pepper mixture.

You can also have your dog stand on a white piece of paper or in a white bathtub and comb its fur. Fleas and flea dirt will either be caught in the comb or fall onto the white surface.

**Fleas on cats**

The same signs of fleas on dogs also apply to cats. A flea-infested cat will bite or scratch itself a lot. And because cats have sharp claws, you might see sores on their skin from all that scratching.

Check your cat's neck or tail base, as these are spots cats can't [groom](https://www.webmd.com/pets/cats/cat-grooming) easily, so fleas make themselves comfortable. You might also find flea dirt and flea eggs on them or their bedding.

You can use the same comb trick to check for fleas on cats. Have your feline stand on a white piece of paper or white pillowcase and run a comb through its fur.

**Fleas on humans**

Fleas don't live on humans because we don't have any fur where they can hide. But they will bite you if no animal is around. Technically, they're not biting as they have no teeth – they use their mouth part to pierce your skin and suck your blood.

## Flea Bites

You're most likely to get a flea bite on your ankles, feet, or calves, rarely on higher parts of your body, unless you happen to be sitting in a flea-infested area.

If a flea bites you, you're likely to get a small itchy red bump, circled by a reddish ring or halo. You may also see a cluster or line of bumps. The saliva that a flea leaves behind is an allergen. Your body sends a chemical called [histamine](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/what-are-histamines) to the area where the flea bit you to remove it. That's what causes the bitten area to swell and itch.

In severe cases, you might also get:

- An allergic reaction (shortness of breath, hives)
- An infection from a disease carried by the flea (fever, headache, body aches, rashes, etc.)

## Flea Bite Treatment

If you've been bitten by a flea, you can treat the bites yourself with:

**An antihistamine.** This is a pill or cream containing a drug to counter the effects of histamine.

**Hydrocortisone.** A steroid cream like hydrocortisone will reduce swelling and itching.

**Ice.** Apply an [ice pack](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/when-use-heat-ice) covered in a towel for 10 minutes at the sore spot to reduce swelling and pain.

**Aloe vera**. Rub the gel from its leaves on your sore spot. It can reduce itching and pain.

Talk to your veterinarian about the best way to control your pet's fleas. They may suggest any of the following:

- Insecticide
- Shampoo
- Spray
- Spot treatment
- Pills
- Liquid formula
- Flea collar
- Flea comb

Be sure to follow the product instructions. If you're using a [pesticide](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-to-know-about-natural-pesticides) or insecticide, wear gloves. Don't let your pet lick off the pesticide after you apply it. Don't use a dog product on a cat, or vice versa.

## Flea Allergy Dermatitis

Some people and pets have a more severe response to flea saliva. It's called flea allergy dermatitis or flea bite hypersensitivity. Your skin or your pet's skin may itch, swell, and redden around each flea bite. Here's why:

To reproduce, an adult flea must have a blood meal by biting a dog, cat, or other mammal. The flea only stays on the body as long as is needed to finish the meal. That's why you often don't see fleas on your pet, though they may be itching, thanks to the saliva they leave in your pet's skin from their feeding.

You can tell if your dog has flea allergy dermatitis because it will be itching and have hair loss from the middle of its back to the base of its tail and rear thighs. In cats, you'll see itching and skin bumps on their face, neck, and back.

Flea treatment for pets involves anti-itching or anti-inflammatory medicine and getting rid of the fleas on their bodies. You'll also need to get rid of the fleas in your pet's environment, like its bedding.

In people, treatment is an antihistamine or and anti-itch cream (hydrocortisone).

If your symptoms worsen or last longer, consult a doctor. And if it's happening to your pet, take it to the vet.

## Can Flea Bites Make You Sick?

Fleas can carry dangerous diseases and transmit them to you and your pets. Among them are:

**Plague**. Rats and rodents transmit this disease to people who get it from handling an infected animal or from a flea bite from an infected rodent. Symptoms include a fever, aches and chills, low blood pressure, weakness, shortness of breath, and [nausea/vomiting](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/understanding-nausea-vomiting-treatment).

**Endemic murine typhus**. Infected fleas transmit this through flea poop, which usually enters the skin when you scratch a flea bite. Symptoms include a headache, joint/muscle pain, a fever/chills, and nausea/vomiting.

**Cat scratch disease**. This is passed on to humans when infected cats scratch or bite them, or lick an open wound. Cats get the infection from flea bites or from fights with other cats that have the disease. Symptoms include a small red [blister](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blisters-basics) near the scratch, swelling, painful lymph nodes, a fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

**Tapeworms**. Tapeworm larvae as well as the larvae of other parasites may infect fleas. Infected fleas may spread these parasites to animals that swallow them while grooming themselves. Sometimes a child – or, rarely, an adult – accidentally swallows an infected flea. Symptoms of parasites include nausea, weakness, [stomach pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/abdominal-pain-causes-treatments), dizziness/headaches, and weight loss.

**Canine bartonellosis**. This is the dog version of cat scratch fever. Fleas can carry the bacteria bartonella and spread it to dogs by flea bites. Symptoms in dogs include a fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore muscles, a nose discharge, a hard time breathing, vomiting/diarrhea, and coughing.

**Anemia**. Blood loss from fleas can cause animals to become very weak. [Anemia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-treatment) (the loss of red blood cells) is more likely to affect kittens and puppies (particularly those that live outdoors) because they're smaller. Symptoms include pale gums, vomiting, a lack of interest in food, and weakness when they stand.

## How to Get Rid of Fleas

Here are some tips for home flea treatment:

- Vacuum regularly the areas where your pet sleeps, sits, and eats, like floors, rugs, furniture, and pet beds. This will pick up fleas, flea dirt, larvae, and flea eggs. Don't forget baseboards and under furniture where fleas like to hide. Toss out the vacuum bag or empty/wash the canister when you're finished.
- Wash all pet bedding in hot water weekly and dry it in a hot dryer, if you can.
- Steam-clean and shampoo carpets, rugs, and furniture. If you notice fleas after doing this (they may hatch because of the warm water), keep vacuuming and cleaning until they're gone.
- Spray the house with a hand sprayer, or in severe cases, use a flea bomb or room fogger. Remove family members and pets from the affected area(s) when using insecticides and follow the label directions closely.

## Flea Prevention Tips

The best way to deal with a flea problem is to prevent it. Follow these strategies for flea control:

- Regularly give your pet a pill to prevent fleas. Your vet can help you pick the right one.
- Have your dog or cat wear a flea collar. Check with your vet before combining a flea collar with flea medication.
- Thoroughly vacuum areas where your pets live or sleep, including floors, carpets, and pet beds. Regular vacuuming can remove up to 95% of flea eggs, as well as some larvae, and adults.
- Groom your pets regularly.
- Remove debris and low-hanging trees and vegetation to reduce fleas. Cut tall grass.
- Seal crawl spaces, areas under porches, and openings to basements, where pets and wild animals like to hide.
- Consider keeping your pets from roaming outdoors, where they're more likely to come into contact with fleas.

## Takeaways

Fleas are tiny wingless parasites that like to feed on blood from your dog or cat. You'll find them in pet fur, pet bedding, carpets, or in bushes or grass outside your home. Once you've killed the fleas on your pet through medication and grooming, keep them from returning by thoroughly cleaning and vacuuming the areas where your pet lives and sleeps. If your dog or cat goes outside, you'll need to do some outdoor maintenance as well.

## FAQs

**What kills fleas on pets instantly?**

Shampoo your pet and/or give it a [flea treatment](https://www.webmd.com/pets/kill-fleas-at-home). Some products are labeled to work in as little as 30 minutes.

**Can humans catch fleas from pets?**

Yes, they can. Fleas won't live on you, but they will bite you if you're close enough.

**What can I do if my pet has fleas?**

Your veterinarian can give your pet a pill to treat the fleas. Then, shampoo your pet to get the fleas out of its fur. Talk with your vet or exterminator about the best ways to remove fleas from your home or garden. Ask your vet about getting a flea collar for your pet.

**How can I prevent a flea infestation in my home?**

The best way is to keep the areas your pet frequents very clean. In your home, sweep the floors and vacuum the carpets and couches often. Wash your pet's bedding in hot soapy water. Keep wild animals (like rodents) from entering your home by sealing up any holes, and store food, including pet food, in tight containers. Many wild animals have fleas.

**What are the best treatments for fleas on pets?**

The best flea treatments for pets are a pill, a flea collar, and an ointment that you can spread on your pet's body. You don't need to give your pet all three treatments. Talk with your vet about what is best, keeping in mind how bad the flea infestation is and what your pet is like. For instance, some pets don't like to take pills.

**What are pulgas?**

Pulgas is the Spanish word for fleas.

When your body doesn't have enough oxygen, you could get [hypoxemia](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/hypoxia-hypoxemia) or hypoxia. These are dangerous conditions. Without oxygen, your [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-diseases), [liver](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-liver-failure), and other organs can be damaged just minutes after symptoms start.

Hypoxemia (low oxygen in your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood)) can cause hypoxia (low oxygen in your tissues) when your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cm/rm-quiz-blood-basics) doesn't carry enough oxygen to your tissues to meet your body's needs. The word hypoxia is sometimes used to describe both problems.

## Symptoms

Although they can vary from person to person, the most common hypoxia symptoms are:

- Changes in the color of your [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin), ranging from blue to cherry red
- Confusion
- [Cough](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/coughs)
- Fast [heart rate](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/watching-rate-monitor)
- Rapid breathing
- Shortness of breath
- Slow heart rate
- [Sweating](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hyperhidrosis2)
- [Wheezing](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/understanding-wheezing-basics)

If you have symptoms of hypoxia, call 911.

## How It's Treated

You'll need to go to the hospital to get treatment for hypoxia and to keep a check on your oxygen level.

The most important thing is to get more oxygen into your body. You'll receive it through a small plug in your nose or through a mask that covers your nose and [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems). For many people, this is enough to bring your oxygen level up to normal.

An inhaler or [asthma medicine](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/asthma-medications) by [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems) may make breathing easier. If these don't help, the doctor might try giving you medicine through a vein in your arm (an IV). You might need [steroid](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ss/slideshow-steroids-101) drugs for a short time to shrink [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) in your [lungs](https://www.webmd.com/lung/healthy-lungs-smokers-lungs) or antibiotics to treat an underlying infection.

When your life is in danger and other treatments aren't working, you may need a machine to help you breathe.

## Causes of Hypoxia

A [severe asthma attack](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/status-asthmaticus), or flare, can cause hypoxia in adults and kids. During an attack, your airways narrow, making it hard to get air into your [lungs](https://www.webmd.com/lung/cm/rm-quiz-lungs-quiz). [Coughing](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ss/slideshow-cough-treatments) to clear your lungs uses even more oxygen and can make symptoms worse.

Hypoxia can also result from lung damage due to trauma.

Other things can cause hypoxia include:

- [Lung diseases](https://www.webmd.com/lung/lung-diseases-overview) such as [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/10-faqs-about-living-with-copd) ( [COPD](https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/10-faqs-about-living-with-copd)), [emphysema](https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/what-is-emphysema), [bronchitis](https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-bronchitis-basics), [pneumonia](https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-pneumonia-basics), and [pulmonary edema](https://www.webmd.com/lung/the-facts-about-pulmonary-edema) (fluid in the lungs)
- Strong pain medicines and other drugs that hold back breathing
- [Heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/high-cholesterol-healthy-heart) problems
- [Anemia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics) (a low number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen)
- Cyanide poisoning (Cyanide is a chemical used to make plastics and other products.)

## Preventing Hypoxia

The best way to prevent hypoxia is to keep your asthma under control, every day. Stick with your [asthma treatment](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/asthma-treatments) plan.

- Take your medicine to help prevent flares and the need to use your rescue inhaler.
- Eat right and stay active.
- Know your [asthma triggers](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/prevention-home), and find ways to avoid them.

Work with your doctor to come up with an action plan for [asthma attacks](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/asthma-attack), so you know what to do when you have [trouble breathing](https://www.webmd.com/lung/breathing-problems-causes-tests-treatments).

## What Is Grounding?

Grounding, also known as earthing, is when you stand on the earth or have contact with a product that’s grounded into the earth. This connects your body to the natural electric charge of the earth, transferring electrons into your body. Some research shows that soaking up electrons can lower inflammation, ease stress, and improve sleep, to name a few.

Also known as vitamin G or electronic nutrition, some experts think grounding fixes an “electron deficiency syndrome” that plays a role in multiple health disorders. In other words, spending time on a grounding mat, walking in your yard, or wading in a lake can counteract the effects of not having direct contact and balance out your body.

## How Does It Work?

The earth is electronically active, with lots of electrons floating on the surface. The human body naturally absorbs electricity from the earth, which produces changes in our bodies that may support our health.

Historically, people were more connected to the earth. They spent more time outdoors with their feet and bodies directly on the ground. But nowadays, most people have little direct contact with the earth. As a result, our bodies build up positive static electric charges that can’t be released unless we connect to the ground. Grounding neutralizes those positive charges by absorbing negative electrons to balance you out.

When connected, the electrons we absorb work as natural antioxidants that neutralize the positively charged free radicals that can damage your body. Exposure to the electrons is vital for functioning at your best. It can improve sleep, heal wounds, and reduce inflammation linked to a variety of health ailments.

Walking or touching the ground isn’t the only way to experience grounding. A variety of grounding products plug into outlets or can be directly inserted into the ground so you can receive electrons that neutralize the positive ones.

## Earthing Products

In today’s busy society, you may not spend as much time barefoot like our ancestors. That's why grounding products can be so helpful. A variety of products can make it easier to spend more time grounded even if you can’t get outside.

From grounding sheets to adhesive patches and earthing shoes, the products are conductive so your body can absorb electrons. You just plug them into a wall outlet with a ground, or place the attached wire into the soil directly.

If you do place a plug into an outlet, make sure it’s properly grounded. You can see if it's correctly grounded with an outlet checker. Some product manufacturers include them when you buy an earthing item. You can find them online or pick one up at a hardware store.

**Grounding mat**

Earthing mats can go under your feet while you sit or stand or on your desk so it touches your hands and arms as you work. Many people sit and meditate on the grounding mats. You can also find yoga mats with grounding technology in them.

**Grounding sheets**

Grounding sheets include a conductive material woven into the fiber. Usually the sheets contain carbon or silver. The material is connected to a wire that can be grounded through a wall outlet or directly outside into the ground. You sleep on them directly.

The silver can become oxidized due to washing and sweat, so the sheets may not be as effective over time, The Earthing Institute reported.

**Grounding mattress pad**

An earthing mattress pad works similar to the sheets, but it can slide on and off your bed. When you use the mattress pad, you can sleep on it directly or place it under sheets. Some manufacturers say there should only be one layer between your body and the mat to maximize conductivity.

**Grounding socks**

Like earthing sheets, the grounding socks enable your body to absorb electrons from the earth because they contain conductive materials like silver. There are two kinds of grounding socks. With the first type, you just slip them on your feet and plug them into an outlet or use the wire included and put the metal rod into the ground directly. The second kind of grounding sock is made out of material that attracts electrons so your body can absorb them. You can wear the socks outdoors directly on the ground if you don’t want to go barefoot.

**Grounding shoes**

Earthing shoes have a conductive plug at the sole of the shoe (near the ball of your foot) to allow electrons to pass into your body.

**Grounding patches**

Another way to bring electrons into your body is to attach a sticky patch onto your skin. The patch snaps onto a cord that can be plugged into the grounding port of an outlet.

**Grounding rod**

Earthing cords, also called grounding rods, are used to connect grounding products directly into the ground when an outlet isn’t available. You just clip it onto the earthing product and push it into moist soil. You can run the cord through an open window or door, and it shouldn’t get damaged.

## Grounding Techniques

Whatever way you choose to connect, it’s important to do it regularly and for a little bit of time.

There’s no set amount of time when a person should practice earthing. In one study, a patient started to feel pain subside in 30 minutes. Another report advised that you should try to get 10 to 20 minutes a day – more if you can.

## Grounding Benefits

Researchers have published studies to document the benefits of grounding, though there’s not a huge amount of definitive evidence to show if it can actually prevent health ailments. A lot of evidence does show changes in the body within several minutes of connecting to the ground or a grounding product.

Authors of a 2020 report said they believe grounding can counteract cardiovascular, respiratory, neurodegenerative, and auto-immune conditions, [type 2 diabetes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/non-insulin-dependent-diabetes-mellitus), and cancer. According to The Earthing Institute, time connected to the ground can improve sleep, lower inflammation, ease stress, improve blood flow, and boost physical healing, to name a few.

**Inflammation**. One of the biggest known benefits of earthing is its ability to lower inflammation, which is linked to a lot of diseases and pain. One study pointed out the differences in concentrations of known indicators of inflammation in the blood of people who grounded compared to those who didn’t. The molecules linked to inflammation went down in people who participated in earthing more than those who didn’t get grounded.

**Blood flow**. One study measured blood flow in people who had 1 hour of contact with the earth compared to those who didn’t. A 2023 report compared grounding and not grounding in people with COVID-19. The people with COVID who tried grounding didn’t have blood clots, while the non-grounded folks did.

In a study of people who did yoga on grounding yoga mats for 1 hour, those on the mats had lower blood thickness, making it easier to flow through the body. Higher blood viscosity is linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and high blood pressure.

Better blood flow can also speed wound healing. That better blood flow may also have benefits for the face and skin.

**Blood pressure**. A small study found grounding was an effective technique to lower blood pressure.

**Sleep**. One study found grounded people had lower nighttime levels of cortisol – too much of the hormone can have negative effects on your health. In the study, grounding better aligned the hormone with a natural 24-hour circadian rhythm. A regular circadian rhythm is linked to better health. A disrupted rhythm can raise your risk for diabetes, obesity, blood pressure problems, and more. Grounding is linked to better restorative sleep and better relaxation. A study on grounding in people with Alzheimer’s disease showed it helped with sleep.

**Heart rate variability**. Your heart rate varies constantly, but [heart rate variability](https://www.webmd.com/heart/what-is-heart-rate-variability) that’s too low is linked to cardiovascular events. One small study saw heart rate variability improvements after 20 minutes of grounding, and it got even better when people grounded longer.

**Anxiety**. Anxiety is linked to lower heart rate variability, so earthing may be a useful therapy for that as well. Some research in rats has shown that grounding can ease stress levels, but there’s not as much on humans. Two small trials in humans found that grounding improved levels of stress, which can contribute to anxiety.

**Thyroid function**. One report found that earthing at night impacted thyroid hormone levels known to impact health. Some people with thyroid problems had to adjust medication after grounding in another experiment, suggesting that grounding may be able to restore thyroid function.

## Grounding Risks

It’s pretty well documented that earthing can affect your body. A few risks do exist, so it’s important to be safe if you choose to try grounding.

## Negative Side Effects of Earthing

You may raise your risk for injury, infection, or allergic reactions from walking barefoot or earthing in open water. Walking barefoot on uneven ground could put you at risk for tripping or falling. Hydrate well if you choose to go outside to practice earthing during warmer months.

If you decide on indoor grounding, don’t use a plug-in product during a thunderstorm as it puts you at risk for electrocution. Earthing enthusiasts recommend checking outlets with a grounding device because wiring that's not properly functioning could cause an electric shock.

Check with your doctor before you start grounding, as it could interact with pregnancy, allergies, immune system problems, existing nerve damage, or issues with your feet.

If you feel any flu-like symptoms or you don’t feel well, stop earthing and contact a health professional. Some people feel a tingling when they start spending more time connected to the earth or a grounding product.

## Takeaways

Ask your doctor if you should try earthing. Some research indicates it can offer health benefits. The practice is relatively safe. Medical studies haven’t proved that grounding can prevent diseases or replace modern medicine, but it may be a way to achieve better health.

## Grounding FAQs

**How do grounding techniques work?**

Unlike practicing meditation or using therapy to feel grounded, grounding is the practice of connecting to the earth either barefoot or via a product that grounds into an outlet or into the earth with a metal rod. Your body absorbs electrons naturally on the earth that are said to balance out your electrical circuit. Some people claim the practice is essential for good health.

**How do you practice grounding techniques?**

Stand on the ground without shoes to practice grounding. You can also opt for grounding products like mats and sheets, which are connected to a grounding port in a wall outlet or can be attached to a grounding wire that you push into the dirt.

**Can grounding relieve stress and anxiety?**

Some studies have shown it can make people feel less stressed.

**How often should one practice grounding?**

You can do as much or as little as you want. Several studies showed that people could experience benefits in 30 minutes or so.

**Does grounding cure insomnia?**

Clinical trials haven’t shown this, though some research (and a lot of reviews from people who practice earthing) indicates that grounding can improve sleep.

**Are there any potential risks of grounding?**

Grounding is generally thought to be safe for most people, but it’s a good idea to ask your doctor if there are any risks. Most risks revolve around walking around barefoot or using a wire during a storm or with a faulty outlet.

Liver lesions are groups of abnormal cells in your [liver](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-liver-failure). Your doctor may call them a mass or a tumor.

Noncancerous, or benign, liver lesions are common. They don’t spread to other areas of your body and don’t usually cause any health issues. But some liver lesions form as a result of [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/).

## Who Gets Them?

![](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/reference_guide/hepatitis_liver_lesions_ref_guide/280x190_hepatitis_liver_lesions_ref_guide.jpg)

Anyone can have a liver lesion, but some things can make you more likely to have cancerous ones:

- [Hepatitis B](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/digestive-diseases-hepatitis-b) or C: These viruses are the main cause of [liver cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-liver-cancer-basic-information).
- [Cirrhosis](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/understanding-cirrhosis-basic-information): You may get this condition if you have hepatitis B or C or if you’re a heavy drinker. It happens when scar tissue grows in place of damaged liver cells, and it can lead to [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/ss/does-this-cause-cancer). About 80% of people who are diagnosed with the most common type of liver cancer, [hepatocellular carcinoma](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/hepatocellular-carcinoma), have cirrhosis.
- Iron storage disease ( [hemochromatosis](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-hemochromatosis)): This is one of the most common genetic disorders in the U.S. It makes your body take in too much iron from food. The extra iron gets stored in your organs, including your liver.
- [Obesity](https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/features/am-i-obese): Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is typically seen in people who are overweight or obese. The condition is caused by a build up of fat in the liver.
- Arsenic: This chemical occurs naturally but can be poisonous. It’s sometimes found in drinking water.
- Aflatoxin: This toxin is created when mold grows on grain and nuts that aren’t stored the right way. It’s very rare in the U.S.

## Symptoms

Benign liver lesions usually don’t cause any symptoms. Many people only find out they have one when they go for an imaging test, like an [ultrasound](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-an-ultrasound), for a different health issue.

If it does cause problems, your symptoms will depend on the type you have. They might include:

- [Bloating](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/burping-reasons), swelling, or [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm) in your belly
- A feeling of fullness
- [Nausea and vomiting](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-nausea-vomiting)
- Weight loss
- Feeling weak or [tired](https://www.webmd.com/women/cm/rm-quiz-fatigue-something-else)
- Yellow [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin) or [eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes)
- [Fever](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/fevers-causes-symptoms-treatments)

## Diagnosis

If your doctor thinks you might have a liver lesion, they’ll probably recommend one or more of these:

- [Blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) tests: They might use these to test for viral [hepatitis](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/default.htm) or to see how well your liver is working. They also may want to check your level of a certain protein (alpha-fetoprotein, or AFP). High amounts of that can be a sign of [liver cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/video/kemeny-liver-cancer-surgery).
- Imaging tests: These can show where a lesion is on your liver and how big it is. A [magnetic resonance imaging](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-an-mri) (MRI) scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images of your liver. A computed tomography (CT) scan is a series of X-rays put together to make a more complete picture. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a special dye that makes your liver show up more clearly. And an ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to make live images of your liver.
- [Biopsy](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-is-a-biopsy): To rule out [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cm/rm-quiz-cancer-myths-facts), your doctor may want to take a small sample of the lesion to look for problem cells.

## Treatment

If you don’t have any symptoms, you may not need to do anything about the lesion. If it’s causing issues for you but it’s not cancerous, your doctor may recommend surgery to take it out and ease your symptoms.

If the lesion is cancerous, you might need one or more of these:

- [Chemotherapy](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/chemotherapy-what-to-expect): This is a combination of powerful [drugs](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) designed to kill cancer cells. It’s the most common treatment for liver lesions that are spreading to other parts of your body.
- Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): This is a targeted type of chemotherapy that takes anti-cancer drugs directly to the lesion. They flow through a tiny tube called a catheter into the [artery](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/clogged-arteries-arterial-plaque) that brings [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cm/rm-quiz-blood-basics) to your liver. This also blocks some of the blood flow to your liver, which keeps the cancer cells from getting the oxygen they need to grow. TACE causes fewer side effects than regular chemotherapy.
- Radiofrequency ablation (RFA): If your lesion is small, your doctor may recommend this procedure. They’ll guide a small probe into the tumor in your liver, usually through tiny cuts in your belly. The probe will give off a certain kind of energy that heats up and kills cancerous cells.

## Prevention

You can lower your chances of getting cancerous liver lesions if you [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm), stay at a [healthy weight](https://www.webmd.com/obesity/healthy-weight), and drink only in moderation (up to two drinks a day for men and one for women).

And you can do a few things to keep from getting hepatitis B or C, which cause 80% of liver cancer cases. You can get vaccinated against hepatitis B, wear [condoms](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-condoms) when you have sex, and don’t share needles if you use them to do recreational drugs.

## What Are Coronaviruses?

Coronaviruses are a big family of different viruses. Some of them cause the common cold in people. Others infect animals, including bats, camels, and cattle. But how did SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, come into being?

Here’s what we know about the history of the coronavirus that was first detected in late 2019 and set off a global pandemic.

## COVID-19 Origins

There are two hypotheses as to COVID-19's origins: exposure to an infected animal or a laboratory leak. There is not enough evidence to support either argument.

The latest intelligence reports agree that the SARS-CoV-2 is not genetically engineered or developed as a [biological weapon](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/what-is-botulism). They do say it is possible a version of a coronavirus was being studied with animals in a lab and exposure occurred there. Again, there is not enough evidence for a definitive conclusion.

Because the first cases of COVID-19 appeared in China, there has been a lot of anti-Asian speech and acts around the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Other recent, serious epidemics have begun on other continents -- Ebola virus and Zika virus, among them. Coronavirus is unique in that a certain racial or ethnic group has been blamed and targeted for the disease.

**Why is it called COVID-19?**

The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally called the 2019 novel (new) coronavirus. The shortened name is COVID-19.

Virus names are based on their genetic structure. The virus that causes COVID-19 was given the name SARS-CoV-2 because it is genetically similar to the [virus](https://www.webmd.com/lung/viral-pneumonia) that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak.

You should use scientific language when referring to coronavirus disease and avoid offensive terms such as “Wuhan flu” or “Chinese flu,” which have led to a rise in anti-Asian racism and violence. It is also not correct to call COVID-19, which has killed nearly 7 million people worldwide as of late 2023, the flu. Coronavirus disease is not caused by a flu (influenza) virus.

**When was the first case of COVID-19?**

There have been numerous studies to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2, but none has been conclusive. The coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe [acute respiratory syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/lung/ards-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome) (SARS) developed from bats.

COVID-19 first appeared on a small scale in November 2019 with the first large cluster appearing in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It was first thought that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan, China’s, open-air “wet markets.” Wet markets are partially or fully open-air markets that sell fresh produce and meat. China's in-country World Health Organization office learned of multiple pneumonia cases of unknown cause with symptoms such as fever and shortness of breath that seemed to be connected to the market.

As COVID-19 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who had no direct contact with [animals](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/pet-allergies-triggers). That meant the virus was transmitted from one human to another. Its spread continued to the U.S. and around the globe, where people unwittingly caught and passed on the virus. The worldwide transmission caused a pandemic to be declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization.

## Coronavirus Evolution

Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. It caused a common cold. Later that decade, researchers found a group of similar human and animal viruses and named them after their crown-like appearance.

Seven coronaviruses can infect humans. The one that causes SARS emerged in southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries. More than 8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died. A small outbreak in 2004 involved only four more cases. This coronavirus causes [fever](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/fevers-causes-symptoms-treatments), headache, and respiratory problems such as cough and shortness of breath.

MERS started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Almost all of the nearly 2,500 cases have been in people who live in or travel to the Middle East. This coronavirus is less contagious than SARS but more deadly, killing 858 people. It has the same respiratory symptoms but can also cause kidney failure.

## Takeaways

COVID-19 is one of seven coronaviruses that are known to infect humans. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is genetically related to the virus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak. There is still no definitive theory as to coronavirus disease's origins. Scientists aren't sure whether it jumped from animals to humans or was developed in a lab. Because the coronavirus disease outbreak began in Wuhan, China, there has been a rash of anti- [Asian](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefit-asian-pears) language and behavior unlike what's been seen in previous disease outbreaks. Several years after the pandemic began, the history of this novel coronavirus is still being written.

## Coronavirus History FAQs

**When was coronavirus 1 first discovered?**

The first human coronavirus was discovered in 1965. Coronaviruses cause respiratory diseases and can infect humans and animals. In humans, the virus can appear as a mild cold or as a more serious disease such as pneumonia.

**What was the first COVID-19 history?**

The virus that causes COVID-19 was a novel coronavirus, meaning it had never infected humans. The virus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and spread rapidly around the globe. It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.

**When were coronaviruses first named?**

The name comes from the viruses' distinctive spikes, which look like a crown. When the first one was discovered in 1965, scientists named it [coronavirus](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dengue-fever-reference).

## What Is Indigestion?

Everyone gets indigestion every once in a while. Indigestion, also called upset stomach or dyspepsia, is a group of digestive symptoms that usually happen at the same time, such as:

- Pain, a burning feeling, or discomfort in your upper belly
- Feeling full too soon while eating
- Feeling uncomfortably full after eating

Occasional indigestion is normal, but sometimes it happens regularly for a few weeks or months. In this case, it may be a sign of an underlying problem, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), ulcers, or gallbladder disease.

**Indigestion vs. heartburn**

Some people use the terms "indigestion" and "heartburn" to mean the same set of symptoms. But, doctors think of them as two different problems that may happen at the same time.

Heartburn is more specific than indigestion. It's a burning feeling in the middle of your chest, sometimes with a sour or bitter taste in your throat and mouth. It may happen after eating a big meal or when you lie down after eating. It's usually caused by acid reflux, when your stomach contents including acid, digestive juices, enzymes, and/or food, flow back up into your esophagus (the food tube leading to your stomach). It's common to get heartburn as part of your indigestion symptoms.

## Indigestion Symptoms

Indigestion almost always includes burning or pain in your upper belly and feeling like you're full too soon or for too long after you finish eating. Other symptoms may include:

- Bloating
- Burping and gas
- Nausea and regurgitation (when the food you swallow comes back up into your esophagus)
- Acid reflux and heartburn
- Loud growling or gurgling in your stomach

**Indigestion burping**

Swallowing a lot of air when you eat or drink may increase the symptoms of burping and bloating. You may swallow a lot of air when you eat or drink too fast, talk while you eat, chew gum, suck on hard candies, drink carbonated drinks, or smoke. Acid reflux can also make you feel the need to swallow more often, which can increase the amount of air you swallow.

Here are some tips to help reduce the amount of air you swallow:

- Eat and drink more slowly. Don't eat when you're stressed or on the run. Make meals a relaxing occasion.
- Avoid fizzy drinks.
- Don't suck on hard candies or chew gum.
- Don't smoke.
- Make sure your dentures fit well if you wear them.
- Take a short walk after you eat.
- Take OTC heartburn relief if you have occasional, mild heartburn.

**Indigestion pain in chest**

Heartburn, angina (reduced blood flow to your heart), and heart attack can all cause a burning sensation in your chest, right behind your breast bone (sternum). If you have persistent chest pain and you're not sure what's causing it, call 911 or go to the ER. If you have had an episode of chest pain and you don't know why--even if it went away after a while--call your doctor. A developing heart attack can cause symptoms that come and go.

**Indigestion and constipation**

Indigestion and constipation often go together. Many people who have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) will also have constipation. Getting relief for your indigestion may also help your constipation. Make sure you talk to your doctor about all your symptoms when you have chronic indigestion and/or constipation.

**How long does indigestion last?**

Your symptoms may last for only a few minutes or as long as a few hours after eating.

## Indigestion Causes

Occasional indigestion is usually caused by eating a large or fatty meal. The symptoms of indigestion come on because large and fatty meals make your digestive system work extra hard. Your stomach stretches and your gallbladder and pancreas contract, and they all make strong digestive juices. All together, this can irritate your stomach.

Indigestion that lasts longer than one meal or that comes and goes may be caused by your lifestyle, a medical condition, or a medicine you take regularly. Sometimes, people have persistent indigestion that's not related to any of these factors. This type of indigestion is called functional or non-ulcer dyspepsia.

**Some lifestyle factors** that may cause indigestion that comes and goes include regularly:

- Eating too much, eating too fast, or eating during stressful situations
- Eating foods that your body has a hard time digesting (food intolerance)
- Smoking or using other tobacco products

**Foods that cause indigestion**

If you eat any of these regularly, stop eating them for a while to see how you do. Add them back in one by one to see if any trigger your indigestion.

Common food triggers for acid reflux, which is a cause of indigestion, include:

- Fatty and fried food
- Spicy foods
- Foods with a lot of acid, like citrus fruit, tomatoes and tomato sauces, and vinegar
- Alcohol
- Fizzy drinks
- Caffeine
- Chocolate
- Onions
- Peppermint

**Some medical conditions** that may cause indigestion include **:**

- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- [Ulcers](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/understanding-ulcers-basic-information)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Too much stomach acid (hyperchlorhydria)
- Slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis)
- Swelling in your stomach lining (gastritis)
- Hiatal hernia (when your stomach pushes through your diaphragm, an organ that helps you breath)
- Bacterial stomach infections
- Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia
- Gallstones and gallbladder swelling (cholecystitis)
- Chronic pancreatitis (swelling in the pancreas)
- Autoimmune conditions, such as thyroid disease or celiac disease
- Pregnancy
- Stomach cancer (very rare)

**Some medicines and dietary supplements** that may irritate your esophagus or cause other symptoms of indigestion include **:**

- Certain antibiotics, such as tetracycline and clindamycin
- Bisphosphonates (used to slow bone loss in osteoporosis and other bone conditions), such as alendronate (Binosto, Fosamax), ibandronate (Boniva), and risedronate (Actonel)
- Iron supplements
- Potassium supplements
- Quinidine
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen
- Anticholinergics (used for overactive bladder and IBS), such as oxybutynin
- Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and doxepin (Silenor)
- High blood pressure and heart disease medicine, such as calcium channel blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and nitrates
- Progesterone (used in some birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy)
- Opioid pain relievers, such as codeine and hydrocodone
- Sedatives or tranquilizers, such as diazepam (Valium) and temazepam (Restoril)
- Theophylline (used in medicine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma)

## Indigestion in Pregnancy

Indigestion is common during pregnancy. You're more likely to get it during pregnancy because of:

- Hormonal changes
- The growing baby pressing against your stomach
- The muscles between your stomach and esophagus relaxing, which allows stomach acid to come back up

If you had indigestion before you were pregnant or you've been pregnant before, you may be more likely to get indigestion than other pregnant people.

**When does heartburn start in pregnancy?**

You may get indigestion or heartburn anytime during your pregnancy, but they're more likely after about 12 weeks.

## Indigestion Diagnosis

Your doctor will ask you about your medical history and perform a physical exam.

Your doctor may also order some tests, such as:

**An upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.** Your doctor will use a small, flexible tube with a light and a camera to look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (the first part of your small intestine). Your doctor may also take some tissue samples for a biopsy at the same time. Using this test, your doctor may be able to see if you have peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, or cancer.

**Other imaging tests, such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or an ultrasound.**

**Tests to look for signs of** _**Heliobacter pylori (H. pylori)**_ **infection.** _H. pylori_ is a bacteria that causes peptic ulcer disease, which can be a cause of chronic indigestion. Your doctor may want you to take a blood or stool test. They may also want you to take a urea breath test. During this test, you swallow a capsule, liquid, or gel that has urea labeled with a special carbon atom in it. _H. pylori_ bacteria will take in the labeled urea and change it to carbon dioxide. If you have _H. pylori_ bacteria in your stomach, you will breathe out this labeled carbon dioxide. Your doctor can then measure how much of this labeled carbon dioxide you breathe out.

## Indigestion Treatment

Treatment usually depends on what is causing your symptoms. You may be able to ease your symptoms by:

- Making changes in how and what you eat and drink, such as avoiding foods that cause indigestion
- Trying psychological therapies to help manage any anxiety, depression, or stress that may cause your indigestion
- Taking over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medicine for indigestion or acid reflux, such as antacids, histamine blockers, proton pump inhibitors, or antibiotics

**Indigestion medicines**

**Antacids neutralize, or offset, the stomach acid that causes indigestion**. Don't take them more than a few times a week. Common OTC antacids are:

- Calcium carbonate (Rolaids, Tums)
- Simethicone (Maalox, Mylanta)
- Sodium bicarbonate (Alka-Seltzer)

**Histamine (H2) blockers lower the amount of acid your stomach makes, so they can both stop and prevent indigestion symptoms.** They take between 1 and 3 hours to take effect but work for several hours. If you take any prescription medications, ask your doctor or pharmacist before you use an H2 blocker because they can interact with certain other drugs. Common H2 blockers include:

- Cimetidine (Tagamet HB)
- Famotidine (Pepcid AC)
- Nizatidine (Axid AR)
- Ranitidine (Zantac 75)

**Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** **reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes.** They may be best for people with both indigestion and heartburn. They take 1 to 4 days to start working. You can use them for up to 14 days, and up to 3 times per year. They can interact with other medications, so check with your doctor or pharmacist before you use them. The most common PPIs that you can buy over the counter are:

- Esomeprazole (Nexium)
- Lansoprazole (Prevacid)
- Omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid)
- Pantoprazole (Protonix)
- Rabeprazole (AcipHex)

**Antibiotics will kill** _**H. pylori**_ **bacteria if that is what's causing your symptoms.** Your doctor will usually give you a combination of two antibiotics, including:

- Amoxicillin
- Clarithromycin
- Metronidazole
- Tetracycline
- Tinidazole

**Prokinetic agents can help your stomach empty faster if you have indigestion because of slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis)**. You'll need a prescription for these. Examples include:

- Bethanechol (Urecholine)
- Metoclopramide (Reglan)

## Home Remedies for Indigestion

You might not need any treatment. [Indigestion](https://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/indigestion-overview) often goes away on its own after a few hours. But let your doctor know if your symptoms get worse.

Unlike medicines that are tested for safety and effectiveness, there are no guidelines to know if home remedies will work for you. Many things can affect how a remedy will work, including the cause of your indigestion, other medications you may be taking, and whether or not you're pregnant. Check with your doctor before trying a natural remedy for indigestion.

But, there are a number of home or natural remedies that that may be worth a try, including:

**Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate).** It's the main ingredient in Alka-Seltzer, and it can neutralize the extra stomach acid that may be the cause of your symptoms. Stir one-half teaspoon of baking soda in 4 oz of water and drink it down. You can repeat this after about 2 hours, but don't take more than 7 doses per 24 hours if you're younger than 60 or more than 3 doses per 24 hours if you're 60 or older. Too much may cause side effects like stomach cramps, nausea, constipation, or diarrhea.

**Chamomile tea.** Chamomile reduces swelling and spasms, and if you drink it warm (not hot), it can help soothe your stomach. If you take blood thinners, talk to your doctor before you try this because chamomile can interact with your medicine and increase your chance of bleeding.

**Licorice root.** Licorice has chemicals that can reduce swelling in your stomach and help food move through your system faster. It may help ease symptoms of indigestion and acid reflux. Chew on the licorice root or use it to make a tea. Don't take more than 2.5 grams per day, though, because it can have side effects if you take too much.

**Fennel seed.** Like licorice, fennel has chemicals that reduce swelling in your stomach. Chewing on about a teaspoon of fennel seeds or drinking fennel tea may help ease the symptoms of indigestion, such as stomach cramps, bloating, and nausea.

**Ginger root.** Ginger also has chemicals that can help food move through your system faster. This can help soothe the nausea and diarrhea that you may have with indigestion, and it can also reduce vomiting. The easiest way to include ginger in your diet is to drink ginger tea, but if you can hold down food, try adding a bit of fresh ginger root to bland foods like rice or oatmeal.

**Peppermint.** Peppermint can relax the muscles in your stomach and esophagus. This may help ease symptoms of indigestion in some people, but it can also increase the symptoms of acid reflux in others. Try sipping on peppermint tea or taking a supplement to see if it works for you.

**Apple cider vinegar.** Raw apple cider vinegar has helpful bacteria that may help balance your gut bacteria. This may help ease the symptoms of indigestion. However, indigestion is often caused by extra stomach acid, and vinegar is acidic. If your indigestion is caused by too much stomach acid, vinegar may make your indigestion symptoms worse. But it's safe to try it because some people do get indigestion from too little stomach acid. You can add a teaspoon of raw apple cider vinegar to a cup of warm water and drink it right before or right after you eat. Don't use apple cider vinegar if you have low potassium because it could make your condition worse. Also, don't use it if you take insulin or water pills because the vinegar could interact with your medicines.

**Aloe vera juice.** Aloe has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant chemicals, and it may also decrease acid production in your stomach. These effects may help ease symptoms of indigestion. It also has a laxative effect and so may ease constipation. People who are allergic to other members of the lily family, such as onions, garlic, and tulips, should not use aloe vera. In general, aloe vera is probably safe to use for up to 2 months, but talk to your doctor before using it for longer. Since it has a laxative effect, it can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

**Bananas.** The vitamins in bananas may help stop muscle spasms in your digestive system. They're low-acid and a gentle source of fiber to help keep food moving through your system. Try eating a banana when you have symptoms to see if it helps.

**Chewing gum.** Chewing sugar-free gum for about 30 minutes after you eat could reduce acid levels in your stomach and esophagus. Watch out for mint-flavored gum, though, because peppermint can make acid reflux symptoms worse in some people.

## Indigestion Prevention

The best way to prevent indigestion is to avoid the foods and situations that seem to cause it. Keeping a food diary may help you identify foods that cause your indigestion.

Lifestyle changes can help ease mild indigestion. Try these to see if they help you:

- Eat small meals more often throughout the day.
- Chew your food slowly and thoroughly before swallowing.
- Try not to chew with your mouth open, talk while you chew, or eat too fast. This makes you swallow too much air, which can make your symptoms worse.
- Avoid drinks and foods that can trigger indigestion, such as caffeine, alcohol, citrus fruits, tomatoes, spicy foods, and fried or fatty foods.
- Don't lie down right after eating. Wait at least 3 hours after your last meal of the day before going to bed.
- Sleep with your head elevated (at least 6 inches) above your feet and use pillows to prop yourself up. This will help allow digestive juices to flow into the intestines rather than to the esophagus.
- If stress is a trigger for your indigestion, learn new methods for managing stress, such as relaxation and biofeedback techniques.
- If you smoke, quit. Smoking can irritate the lining of the stomach.
- Get to and stay at a healthy weight. Extra weight puts pressure on your stomach and lower esophagus. Exercising regularly not only helps you get to a healthy weight, but it can also help you digest your food better.

If you don't feel better after trying these changes, talk to your doctor. They may prescribe medicines for you or suggest a good OTC medicine to help ease your symptoms.

## When Should I Call the Doctor About Indigestion?

Because indigestion can be a sign of a more serious health problem, call your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:

- Persistent indigestion that's not relieved by antacids, or if you're taking antacids frequently
- Difficulty swallowing
- A feeling of tightness in your chest or shortness of breath
- Nausea and vomiting
- Vomiting, blood in your vomit, or vomit that looks like coffee grounds
- Black, tarry poop or visible blood in your poop
- [Weight loss](https://www.webmd.com/diet/lose-weight-fast), especially if you haven't been trying to lose weight

Symptoms similar to indigestion may be caused by heart attacks. If you have symptoms of indigestion and shortness of breath, sweating, chest pain, or pain radiating to the jaw, neck, or arm, call 911 immediately.

## Indigestion FAQs

**Does drinking water help indigestion?**

Drinking water may help ease some of your symptoms. Small sips of water can help food move through your digestive system faster and dilute your stomach acid. Water may also wash acid back down your esophagus if you have acid reflux.

**What is indigestion with no cause?**

Indigestion without a cause is sometimes called functional dyspepsia. That means your doctor can't find a medical cause of your symptoms. Otherwise, there's no difference between indigestion and functional dyspepsia. Your doctor will diagnose and treat both the same.

**What is indigestion sometimes mistaken as?**

The symptoms of severe indigestion or heartburn and a heart attack can be very similar. Go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of indigestion or heartburn and pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing sensation in your chest or arms, shortness of breath, cold sweat, and sudden dizziness. You're more likely to have a heart problem if you also have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, are overweight, and you smoke.

## Takeaways

It's perfectly normal to get indigestion or an upset stomach every once in a while. You can usually treat it yourself by making a few lifestyle changes and taking an over-the-counter antacid. If you have indigestion often, though, it may be because of an underlying medical condition. If you're having indigestion more than a couple of times a week or if it lasts a long time, visit your doctor so they can help you find relief. If you have symptoms that don't get better with antacids, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, or cold sweats, call 911 or go to the ER right away because the symptoms of indigestion and heartburn and heart attack can be very similar.

## What Are Cat Allergies?

Life with [cat allergy symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/cat-allergies) – whether they're your or a family member's – can raise a lot of questions. Could an allergy to cats explain your son's never-ending [cold symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/common_-cold-symptoms)? Will you regret giving in to your daughter's demands for a kitten, despite your allergies? Will a so-called hypoallergenic cat allow you to have the pet you've always wanted without making you a [sneezing](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/know-your-allergy-triggers), sniffling mess?

Read on to learn what you need to know about [cat allergies](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/pet-allergies-triggers), from causes to treatments to avoidance.

## Cat Allergy Symptoms

Allergies due to cats can cause a range of symptoms that cause irritation and affect your breathing and skin.

**Symptoms of cat allergies in adults**

Symptoms of cat allergies can include:

- [Coughing](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/coughs) and wheezing
- [Hives](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/skin-conditions-hives-urticaria-angioedema) or a [rash](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/common-rashes) on the chest and face
- Red, itchy [eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes)
- Redness of the skin where a cat has scratched, bitten, or licked you
- A runny, itchy, stuffy nose
- [Sneezing](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/cm/rm-quiz-sneezing)

Symptoms of an allergy caused by a cat might turn up in just a few minutes or take hours to appear.

**Cat allergy rash**

Also called allergic dermatitis, allergies caused by cats can also trigger skin symptoms. You may have hives, eczema, or itchy skin.

**Cat allergy symptoms in babies and toddlers**

Kids who are allergic to cats have similar symptoms as adults, including:

- Itchy eyes
- Sneezing
- A runny nose
- Throat irritation
- Asthma symptoms (cough, wheezing, shortness of breath)

**Severe cat allergy symptoms**

Symptoms of cat allergies can sometimes turn serious. About 20% to 30% of people with [allergic asthma](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/allergic-asthma) have severe flare-ups after coming in contact with a cat. Call a doctor or get emergency help if you're wheezing, you can't breathe through your nose, you have trouble sleeping, or have shortness of breath.

## What Causes Symptoms of Cat Allergies?

About 10% of the U.S. population has [pet allergies](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/pet-allergies-triggers), and cats are among the most common culprits. Cat allergies are twice as common as [dog allergies](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/dog-allergies). But contrary to what you might think, it's not the fur or hair that's the real problem. People with cat allergies are really allergic to proteins in the cat's [saliva](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/what-is-saliva), urine, and dander (dried flakes of skin). You're also more likely to have a pet allergy if someone else in your family also has one.

How do these tiny proteins cause such a big [allergic reaction](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergic-reaction-causes) in the body? People with [allergies](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergy-symptoms) have oversensitive immune systems. Their bodies mistake harmless things – like cat dander – for dangerous invaders and attack them as they would bacteria or viruses. The symptoms of the allergy are the side effects of your body's assault on the allergen, or trigger.

Keep in mind that even if you don't have actual cat allergy symptoms, your cat can still indirectly cause your allergies to flare up. Outside cats can bring in [pollen](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/pollen_allergies_overview), mold, and other allergens on their fur.

## How Do I Know if I’m Allergic to Cats?

Although cat allergy symptoms may seem pretty obvious, it's not always the cat that causes them. It's a good idea to get proof from your doctor. After all, you wouldn't want to blame Mr. Whiskers unjustly.

**Cat allergy test**

Your doctor can do a skin or blood test to see if you're allergic. During a skin test, the doctor pricks small amounts of purified allergen extracts, like those from animals, into your skin. You usually take the test on your forearm and sometimes on your upper back. After 15 minutes, your doctor or nurse checks your skin for allergic reactions. For instance, if you're allergic to cats, you'll see a red, itchy bump where the cat extract was pricked.

Sometimes, a skin test isn't possible due to skin conditions or certain medications. Instead, your doctor might suggest a blood test. This test checks your blood for specific allergy-causing antibodies related to common allergens, including animals. It can also show how sensitive you are to an allergen.

Keep in mind that [allergy tests](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/guide-chapter-allergies-tests-diagnosis) aren't always accurate. The doctor may also want you to try living without a cat for a few months to see how it affects your [allergy symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergy-symptoms).

## Cat Allergy Treatment

Unfortunately, there's no way to prevent an allergy. Some studies have shown that exposure to pets as a young child seems to lower your chances of forming pet allergies later. On the other hand, a child who already has allergic tendencies may get worse with exposure to a pet. You can usually control the symptoms of cat allergies with standard allergy drugs. Your doctor might suggest:

**Cat allergy medicine**

- [**Antihistamines**](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/antihistamines-for-allergies) **,** which are available over the counter – like cetirizine ( [Zyrtec](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-12127/zyrtec+oral/details)), diphenhydramine ( [Benadryl](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5680/benadryl+oral/details)), fexofenadine ( [Allegra](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5485/allegra-d+12+hour+oral/details)), and loratadine ( [Claritin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5346/claritin+oral/details)), or some antihistamines such as azelastine (Astelin) that come in a nasal spray
- [**Decongestants**](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants) **,** like over-the-counter pseudoephedrine ( [Sudafed](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6573/sudafed+oral/details)) or allergy drugs that contain the ingredient pseudoephedrine, such as Allegra-D, Claritin-D, or Zyrtec-D
- **Nasal steroid sprays,** which affect allergy or [asthma symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/asthma-symptoms) in various ways, are a common treatment for allergies. Budesonide (Rhinocort), fluticasone (Flonase), and triamcinolone (Nasacort Allergy 24HR) are over-the-counter steroid sprays.

**Cat allergy shots**

Allergy shots are another option. But they don't always work well, and completing treatment can take years. Children under age 5 can't use them, but allergy shots can be a huge help to some people. Ask your doctor if they make sense for you.

**Home remedies**

You can also treat cat allergy symptoms with nasal irrigation **.** To clear out thick mucus and irritants from your sinuses, use a neti pot or a squeeze bottle with a saline rinse. If you're making the saline solution at home, use clean water, such as distilled, boiled and cooled, or filtered water. After each use, rinse the device with clean water and let it air dry.

## Reducing the Risk of Cat Allergies

While medical treatment can help control cat allergies, the best approach is simple: Avoid cats and their dander. Here are some tips.

**Reduce exposure to cats**

- Protect yourself. When around cats, wear a mask with an N95 respirator, and wash your hands with soap and water if you touch them.
- Beware of visitors who own cats. Even if your house guests leave their cats at home, they can bring the dander with them on their clothing and luggage. This indirect exposure can cause serious cat [allergy symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergic-reaction-causes) in some people.
- Plan. If you have to stay in a house with cats, ask that the cat be kept out of the room where you will sleep for a few weeks before arriving. Also, start taking allergy [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/index) a few weeks beforehand. Once an [allergic reaction](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergic-reaction-causes) starts, it can be tough to control, but taking medicine can prevent it from happening in the first place.

But what if you already own a cat? Here's the most sensible advice: If you or a family member has cat allergies, you shouldn't have a cat in the home.

Of course, such harsh advice may not be easy to follow. What if your kids have already fallen in love with a kitten? What if you intended to never, ever part with your cat? If the cat has to stay, there are other things you can try.

**Use HEPA air filters**

A central air cleaner and HEPA filters on the vents can help prevent cat dander from circulating throughout the house.

**Bathe and brush the cat regularly**

Experts aren't sure if bathing your cat really helps reduce the amount of allergen. But if it doesn't traumatize them too badly, you could try it and see if it lowers symptoms.

**Reduce exposure to cat dander**

Here are some other ideas for avoiding cat dander and allergy symptoms:

- Keep your distance. Limit exposure to the cat. Certainly, another family member should take responsibility for the cat's care and do things like cleaning the litter box.
- Restrict the cat to certain sections of the house. Don't allow your cat to roam free. Keep the cat out of your bedroom at all times.
- Clean rigorously and often. Cat dander gets everywhere, so sweep and mop the floors, vacuum the rugs, and clean furniture regularly. Make sure to get a vacuum with a [HEPA filter](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/hepa-filters-for-allergies) because regular filters may not be fine enough to catch allergens. Get rid of carpets and drapes that can trap dander.

**Hypoallergenic cats**

And what about so-called hypoallergenic cats? While some breeds – like the "hairless" sphynx – are said to be less likely to trigger symptoms of cat allergies than others, any cat has the potential to cause problems. This is true regardless of its breed, hair length, or how much it sheds. So if you know that you or another family member is allergic to cats, getting one – no matter what the breed – is not a good idea.

While these techniques might help, they may not be enough. As hard as it might be, if keeping your cat is putting your health – or a family member's health – at risk, you have to consider giving it up.

Whatever you do, don't assume that you can wait it out, that cat allergies will naturally get better over time. They might very well get worse. Out-of-control allergies can do more than make life miserable – they can increase the risk of asthma, which can be a serious disease.

So don't ignore the signs of cat allergies. Instead, see a doctor. Together, you can figure out the best way to tackle the problem.

## Takeaways

Cat allergy symptoms happen due to proteins in a cat's saliva, urine, and dander, affecting around 10% of people in the U.S. Even if you're not allergic to cats, they can bring in other allergens from outside. While some breeds are "hypoallergenic," any cat has the potential to cause issues. Symptoms of a cat allergy include coughing, wheezing, itchy eyes, and skin irritation, often showing up quickly after contact. To confirm an allergy, consult a doctor for tests, and consider avoiding cats altogether if you or a family member is allergic. Treatment options include antihistamines, decongestants, nasal steroid sprays, and allergy shots, though prevention remains the best approach.

Diabetes happens when your blood sugar (blood glucose), which is your body's primary energy source, is too high. There are two types of diabetes:

- Type 1 diabetes means your body doesn't make enough insulin. Doctors usually diagnose the condition in kids and young adults, but you can get it at any age. You'll need daily insulin.
- Type 2 diabetes is the most common type, and it means your body doesn't use insulin the right way. Your chances of getting the disease go up if you are overweight or obese or if other people in your family have diabetes.

## What Are the Early Signs of Diabetes?

Both [types of diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/types-of-diabetes-mellitus) have some of the same telltale warning signs.

**Increased hunger**

Your body converts the food you eat into glucose, which your cells use for energy. But your cells need insulin to take in glucose. If your body doesn't make enough or any insulin, or if your cells resist the insulin your body makes, the glucose can't get into them and you have no energy. This can make you hungrier than usual.

**Fatigue and tiredness**

A lack of insulin and glucose can also make you more tired than usual.

**Peeing more often**

The average person usually has to pee about four to seven times in 24 hours, but people with diabetes may go a lot more. Why? Normally, your body reabsorbs glucose as it passes through your kidneys. But when diabetes pushes your [blood sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes) up, your kidneys may not be able to bring it all back in. This causes the body to make more urine, and that takes fluids. The result: You'll have to go more often. You might pee out more, too.

**Frequent thirst**

Because you're peeing so much, you can get very thirsty.

**Dry mouth**

Because your body is using fluids to make pee, there's less moisture for other things. You could get dehydrated, and your mouth may feel dry.

**Itchy and dry skin**

Your skin could also feel dry, which may start to itch as well.

**Blurred vision**

Changing fluid levels in your body could cause the lenses in your eyes to swell. They would then change shape and be unable to focus.

**Unintentional weight loss**

If your body can't get energy from your food, it will start burning muscle and fat for energy instead. You may lose weight even though you haven't changed how you eat.

**Can diabetes cause headaches?**

Headache may be a symptom of [hypoglycemia](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-hypoglycemia), or low blood sugar. It happens when your sugar or glucose level drops very low.

## Early Warning Signs of Type 1 Diabetes vs. Type 2 Diabetes

How can you tell if you have diabetes? Most early symptoms are due to higher-than-normal glucose levels in your blood. While symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the same, there's a difference in how they appear.

In [type 1 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-1-diabetes), symptoms show up quickly, in just a few days or weeks, especially in children. The four most common symptoms are:

- Peeing more often
- Constant thirst
- Tiredness and a lack of energy
- Unintended weight loss

Type 2 [diabetes symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/understanding-diabetes-symptoms) may be mild and develop more slowly, especially early on in the disease. It's possible to go for years without realizing you have the condition.

## Early Signs of Diabetes in Women vs. Men

There's no major difference in early diabetes signs between men and women, but there may be a few contrasts. Women with the condition may have vaginal yeast infections and urinary tract infections more often, while men with untreated diabetes tend to lose muscle mass.

## Early Signs of Diabetes in Children

**Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children**

Type 1 diabetes can happen at any age but tends to crop up in children aged 5 to 6 and 11 to 13. Researchers think this is due to hormones at these ages. Symptoms include:

- Extreme hunger or thirst
- Peeing more often, including wetting the bed
- Extreme tiredness
- [Blurred vision](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/why-is-my-vision-blurry)
- Crankiness or behavior changes
- Vaginal [yeast infection](https://www.webmd.com/women/understanding-vaginal-yeast-infection-basics) in prepubescent girls
- Diaper rash in babies

**Early symptoms of type 2 diabetes in children**

Adults are more likely to get type 2 diabetes, but the disease is happening more often in kids because of obesity. Your child may not show any symptoms of the disease, but here are some to look out for:

- Extreme hunger or thirst
- Peeing more often
- Extreme tiredness
- Blurred vision
- Skin darkening, especially around the neck, groin, and armpits
- Unintended weight loss (this happens more often in type 1 diabetes)
- Repeated infections

## Early Signs of Gestational Diabetes

High blood sugar during [pregnancy](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-am-i-pregnant) usually has no symptoms. You might feel a little thirstier than normal, have to pee more often, have a dry mouth, or feel tired.

If you have an average chance of getting [gestational diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/gestational-diabetes), your doctor will likely screen you for the condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But your doctor may test you early in your pregnancy, possibly at your first prenatal visit, if:

- You're more likely to get gestational diabetes because you're overweight.
- Gestational diabetes runs in your family.
- You've had it during a previous pregnancy.

The screening involves drinking a sugary solution and having your blood sugar tested an hour later. If your blood sugar is high, you'll need a follow-up test, where you'll drink a stronger solution and have your [blood sugar tested](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diagnosing-type-2-diabetes) every hour for 3 hours.

## Warning Signs of Diabetes Complications

Signs of type 2 diabetes complications may include:

- Slow-healing sores or cuts
- Itchy skin (usually around the vaginal or groin area)
- Frequent yeast infections
- Recent weight gain
- Velvety, dark skin changes of the neck, armpit, and groin, called [acanthosis nigricans](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acanthosis-nigricans-overview)
- Numbness and tingling of the hands and [feet](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/foot-pain-causes-and-treatments)
- Decreased vision
- Impotence or [erectile dysfunction](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/understanding-erectile-dysfunction-basics) (ED)

Learn about what you can do to lower your risk of diabetes complications.

## When to Call Your Doctor

If you're older than 45 or have other risks for diabetes, it's important to get tested. When you spot the condition early, you can avoid nerve damage, [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/high-cholesterol-healthy-heart) trouble, and other complications.

As a general rule, call your doctor if you:

- Feel sick to your stomach, weak, and very thirsty
- Are peeing a lot
- Have a bad belly ache
- Are breathing more deeply and faster than normal
- Have sweet breath that smells like nail polish remover (a sign of very high ketones)

## Takeaways

Diabetes often starts with mild symptoms such as feeling very hungry and tired, needing to pee a lot, being very thirsty, having a dry mouth, itchy skin, and blurry vision. Type 1 diabetes symptoms appear quickly and are more severe, while [type 2 symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes) develop slowly. It's important to see a doctor if you have symptoms or have a higher chance of getting diabetes to avoid serious health problems.

In most cases, [lupus](https://www.webmd.com/lupus/ss/slideshow-lupus-overview) is not fatal. In fact, 80% to 90% of people who have this [autoimmune disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autoimmune-diseases) will likely live a normal life span. Still, some people do die from the disease, in which your [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function) attacks your body's organs and tissues.

## Is There a Cure for Lupus?

Not yet, though research continues. There has been more progress in lupus research in the last 10 years than in the previous 100 years. That’s why some experts believe a cure may be possible in the coming years.

In the meantime, you and your doctors can work together to come up with the best treatment plan to treat your symptoms and limit damage to your organs.

## Why Do Some People Die From Lupus?

[Lupus symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/lupus/understanding-lupus-symptoms) can vary widely from mild to moderate to really bad. The cases with frequent serious flare-ups are the cases doctors find hardest to treat. They’re also the ones most likely to shorten life span.

Still, it’s important to note that most people with lupus rarely have a flare-up serious enough to require hospitalization.

## What Forms of Lupus Are Most Likely to Shorten Lifespan?

Typical causes of death from lupus are complications from:

- Kidney damage: The most common form of lupus, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), can cause serious damage to the kidneys that can shorten lifespan. Your doctor might call this [lupus nephritis](https://www.webmd.com/lupus/lupus-nephritis).
- Heart damage: Lupus can inflame your arteries as well as the heart muscle and other tissue. This raises your risk for cardiovascular disease as well as [heart attacks](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-disease-heart-attacks).
- Infection: Because it’s an autoimmune disease, lupus can weaken your immune system. And the drugs used to treat the disease can weaken it further. Together these factors raise your risk for infection that can become more serious because even after you get it, your body (for the same reasons) is less able to fight it.

Though it’s possible to do everything right and still develop these serious lupus complications, there are things that raise your risk of complications such as:

- Late diagnosis: It’s harder to control lupus if symptoms have been allowed to develop untreated for some years.
- Poor health care access: You may not be aware of your lupus without regular visits to your doctor. And you can’t treat the disease until you and your doctor know you have it.
- Not taking your medication: You’re more likely to get serious flare-ups that lead to complications if you don’t keep to the treatment steps prescribed by your doctor.

## What Can You Do To Slow The Development of Your Lupus?

To start with, try to notice any symptoms of illness and talk to your doctor about them. This helps in two ways:

- You get an early diagnosis so you can start treatment as soon as possible.
- Once you have your [lupus diagnosis](https://www.webmd.com/lupus/laboratory-tests-used-diagnose-evaluate-sle), you and your doctor will be able to get ahead of flare-ups and treat them as soon as you notice the first signs and symptoms.

Once you have a lupus diagnosis, the best thing you can do is follow the prescribed treatment of your doctor both for general treatment and for flare-ups. You risk more serious flare-ups and even complications if you don’t follow your treatment plan.

In addition, you and your doctor can work together to identify and avoid triggers for your flare-ups. Though each person is different, common lupus triggers include:

- Too much sun or fluorescent light
- Too much work without enough rest
- Infection
- Certain medications (ask your doctor which ones)

Beyond that, you can try to eat a balanced, healthy diet, exercise regularly, and get between 7-9 hours of good quality sleep per night.

## How Do You Manage The Most Serious Lupus Cases?

In a rare case where lupus gets worse, you may want to consider talking to your doctor about palliative care, although it can be started at any time during a chronic illness like lupus.

Sometimes called “comfort care,” palliative care helps to address issues like your pain levels, tiredness, sleep issues, and emotional well-being. It’s not just for people with illnesses likely to cause death. Anyone with a serious illness may benefit from palliative care. The aim is to provide the best quality of life possible.

In the case of end-stage lupus, you may still be getting “regular” care from your health care team when palliative care starts. In fact, you may get it from the same health care team. But in some cases, especially in the last stages, you may receive [hospice care](https://www.webmd.com/palliative-care/hospice-care), which is comfort care offered to a person who is terminally ill. At this point, you normally stop preventative treatments and concentrate on comfort. This may involve not just medical professionals, but also nutritionists, social workers, therapists, and clergy.

Everyone feels a little unsure at times. As humans, we constantly think, and some of our thoughts can be filled with doubt. This can lead to thoughts of insecurity. Too much insecurity can lead to other problems — in relationships and in your everyday life. However, there are ways you can work through your insecure thoughts and live life more confidently.

## What Is Insecurity?

Insecurity is a feeling of inadequacy (not being good enough) and uncertainty. It produces [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/causes-anxiety) about your goals, relationships, and ability to handle certain situations.

Everybody deals with insecurity from time to time. It can appear in all areas of life and come from a variety of causes. It might stem from a traumatic event, patterns of previous experience, social conditioning (learning rules by observing others), or local environments such as school, work, or home.

It can also stem from general instability. People who experience unpredictable upsets in daily life are more likely to feel insecure about ordinary resources and routines.

On the other hand, insecurity can have no definite, external cause. Instead, it can appear as a quirk of personality or [brain chemistry](https://www.webmd.com/brain/default.htm).

Understanding the nature of insecurities can help you manage your own and offer others the support they need.

## Types of Insecurity

There are almost limitless areas of potential insecurity. Moreover, insecurity often bleeds over from one area of life into another. However, there are some types of insecurity that appear frequently.

**Relationship Insecurity**

One of the most common kinds of insecurity concerns relationships or “attachments.”

Attachment theory originated out of a desire to connect the attachment patterns of early childhood to later relationship patterns and expectations. When a child’s “ [attachment figures](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/what-is-attachment-parenting#1),” often parents or guardians, aren’t reliably available and supportive, the child often feels insecure, forms a negative self-image and relationship models, and experiences greater emotional distress and maladjustment later in life.

Relationship or attachment insecurities don’t need to begin in early childhood. They can arise wherever previous experience or personal insecurity undermines someone’s security in their closest relationships.

**Job Insecurity**

Job insecurity occurs when you are anxious about your continued employment or about the continuation of certain benefits attached to your employment. It can be triggered by anxiety over your own job performance or anxiety over factors beyond your control, such as the economy, industry trends, workplace conflict, or the danger of company restructuring or failure.

High rates of unemployment and temporary work increase job insecurity on a national scale and contribute to widespread [mental health](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/default.htm) problems.

**Body Image Insecurity**

A common source of insecurity is body image. Many people feel insecure about the way they look and question whether they measure up to an imposed ideal. There is no necessary connection between actual body health or appearance and body insecurity. People of all body types can experience this type of insecurity.

**Social Insecurity/Anxiety**

Another common type of insecurity surrounds the way we are perceived by our peers and the ease with which we interact with them. This insecurity can be a recurring, low-level problem or can blossom into full-blown [social anxiety disorder](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-social-anxiety-disorder#1) or social phobia.

## Signs of Insecurity

Signs of insecurity are as variable as the condition itself, but there are some common tendencies you can look out for.

**Low or Superficial Self-Esteem**

One sign of insecurity is low self-esteem or negative self-image, particularly when that image seems to be inconsistent with external observation. Low self-esteem means you think badly about yourself or your abilities. It can lead to other problems, especially concerning mental health. Talk to a doctor if your self-esteem is very low.

Because the measurement of self-esteem generally relies on self-report, insecurity can lead to superficial self-esteem. People with insecurity often want to appear secure, and their explicit comments may be at odds with their automatic responses to certain stimuli.

Deliberate self-misrepresentation or false behavior/information on social media can also be a sign of social anxiety. The act of faking then reinforces the social insecurity.

**Perfectionism**

The inability to be satisfied with progress and need to control and refine projects until they’re perfect can be a sign of insecurity. It stems from the sensation that you or your performance is never enough.

It can appear as a manifestation of insecurity in any area of life but is frequently found in cases of job insecurity and body insecurity. [Eating disorders](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/signs-of-eating-disorders#1), for example, often appear along with both harmful perfectionism and attachment insecurities.

**Self-Isolation**

Social insecurity can lead people to avoid social interactions, isolating themselves. Sometimes these people prefer to interact virtually in internet situations they feel they can control.

**Anxious or Avoidant Attachment Styles**

Attachment insecurities often result in problematic attachment styles, or dysfunctional approaches to relationships. The two most common are anxious or avoidant attachments.

Anxious attachment styles are characterized by emotional dependence (relying on someone else for your emotional well-being), a fear of [being alone](https://blogs.webmd.com/relationships/20200923/how-to-lessen-your-loneliness), and fantasies of perfect relationships that can never be fulfilled.

Avoidant attachment styles also stem from insecurity but go in the other direction. People with this style tend to keep relationships superficial and disengage from more intimate connections.

**Poor Job Performance**

Job insecurity (not having a stable job) can work to motivate some people, but it more often results in poorer performances. It can lead to absenteeism (avoiding work), turnover intention (wanting to change jobs soon after starting), disengagement from colleagues and in group projects, and poor work attitudes.

[**Depression**](https://www.webmd.com/depression/default.htm) **or Anxiety**

All types of insecurity can lead to decreased mental wellness. Depressive or anxious behavior or thinking is often an effect of insecurity, particularly when that insecurity produces (or is accompanied by) erroneous beliefs and patterns of thought.

## Dealing with Insecurity

Occasional insecurity is a natural part of life. For deeper and more longer-lasting feelings of insecurity, however, professional [therapists](https://blogs.webmd.com/relationships/20190522/how-to-choose-a-therapist) can help you sort through your emotions and develop strategies for everyday life.

In dealing with insecurity, there are a couple of helpful tips to keep in mind.

**Social Networks Matter**

Broad and meaningful social networks — [friendships](https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/social-ties-16/friendship-health-stats), relationships with coworkers, and more — help to lessen both insecurity and its negative effects.

There’s an inverse correlation between healthy social networks and insecure attachment styles. Having a wide circle of friends and many close connections allows you to develop the tools and confidence to engage in deeper adult relationships.

Developing good friendships both in and out of the workplace also has a proven record of success as a coping strategy that helps prevent job insecurity, depression, and general anxiety. People who disengage from colleagues in response to job insecurity more frequently suffer in their mental health and job performance.

**Trust Takes Practice**

While having an overly trusting behavior creates its own problems, ask yourself if you have any reason to distrust expressions of affection or liking from others. People with insecurities sometimes express doubt and perceive rejection in everything from partner relationships to new acquaintances. These expressions can be self-fulfilling.

Practice taking displays of interest at face value, something that can be easier in more casual relationships. You can build up the confidence to accept deeper affection and intimacy.

Inappropriate peeing is one of the most common problems people have with their feline friends. It can happen for many reasons. Medical issues such as kidney problems and arthritis can cause your cat to urinate in the wrong place. If these issues have already been ruled out, the cause is a behavioral one.

## Why Do Cats Spray or Urine Mark?

Communicating through smells is normal in the animal world. If you’ve ever walked a dog, you know they spend half the time sniffing around, looking for the perfect place to mark. Cats are territorial as well but have different ideas about managing territory.

Cats have a unique social structure. They see themselves as equal to other cats. They don’t like to share territory, and, when forced to, they don’t have a system like dogs for determining who’s in charge. Cats aren’t well equipped to handle confrontation. When confrontation or change happens, they can get stressed. “Spraying,” or urine marking, is their way of telling other cats or new people to back off without a direct confrontation.

Your cat may be spraying to communicate about territory or something else. Feline urine marking may happen because your cat feels:

- Threatened
- An urge to mate and is trying to attract other cats
- Stressed
- Discomfort from a medical issue

## Litter Box Problems vs. Communication Problems

In some cases of inappropriate peeing, there’s [an issue with the litter box](https://pets.webmd.com/cats/controlling-cat-litter-box-odor#1) that forces your cat to do their business elsewhere. Look for these signs to tell the difference between a litter box problem and feline urine marking:

- A cat that’s spraying will have their tail straight up in the air and project their rear toward the target. The tail may shake or quiver.
- A cat that’s spraying will usually only mark with urine and will still use the litter box regularly. It’s rare for a cat to mark with stool.
- A cat that has a litter box problem will leave their excrement on the floor or other horizontal surface. A cat that’s spraying will usually leave their urine on a vertical surface, like a wall.

## Urine Marking in a Household With More Than 1 Cat

Cats don’t like change. They can give a frosty reception to anyone from a visitor to a new baby, and may be aggravated when a new pet is brought into the home. That’s because they aren’t equipped to deal with confrontation.

Since cats see each other as equals and don’t follow a hierarchy like dogs do, they usually move around the house independently of one another — that includes eating, perching, and visiting the litter box. This doesn’t mean it will be a conflict-free zone.

Conflict between cats often goes unnoticed by cat owners, because it comes in subtle ways before it escalates. Cat conflict style could be described as passive-aggressive. They may stare at each other silently or block each other from food dishes before escalating to spraying, hissing, and fighting. [You might notice your cat losing weight](https://pets.webmd.com/cats/guide/my-cat-wont-eat#1) if they don’t have access to the food bowl. Since cats spray to mark their territory, keeping the conflict level low is in everyone’s best interests. Recent studies have shown that cats who spray could also be experiencing long-term stress.

In multi-cat households, it’s important to first determine that cat spraying or soiling isn’t happening because another cat is bullying and denying them access to the litter box. Separating cats may be necessary to find out who the offender is.

You can help your cats avoid conflict by setting up their environment to make sure all pets have easy access to what they need and to [avoid other behavioral problems.](https://pets.webmd.com/cats/ss/slideshow-behaviorial-problems-in-cats)

- Spread resources like food, water, and litter boxes around the house to make sure each cat has access.
- Be sure to have one litter box per cat, plus one extra.
- Have different areas for your cats to perch, each with space for only one cat.
- You may need to separate your cats by creating individual spaces for them. Closed doors and baby gates can come in handy.
- Spread the love. Set aside time to play and cuddle with each of your cats so they all feel equally loved.
- Reduce anxiety by using a pheromone diffuser. These are commonly sold at pet stores.

**Urine marking in intact cats.** An intact cat is a cat that hasn’t been spayed or neutered. These cats have a higher tendency to mark, due to the hormones they make. Neutering will decrease the odor and motivation to spray, but feline urine marking still happens in up to 10% of neutered cats.

**Spraying caused by conflict with outdoor cats.** Indoor cats can get upset when they see an outdoor cat. They can get more agitated if the outdoor cat begins spraying nearby. If that happens, your cat may start to mark their territory by spraying inside the house.

If this is the case, close the curtains or block any view your cat might have of the outdoor cat. Using a pheromone diffuser will help your cat relax and reduce their anxiety. Try speaking to the neighbor who owns the cat or setting up remote deterrents that emit sound.

**Does gender matter when it comes to cat spraying?** Both male and female cats can spray. Unneutered male cats are the most likely to mark. They also have the strongest smelling urine. About 5% of neutered females and 10% of neutered males continue urine marking after they’ve been fixed.

## What to Do When Your Cat Sprays

The right response to spraying can help discourage your cat from doing it again. When your cat sprays:

1. Clean soiled areas using mild-fragrance soap. You may need an enzymatic cleaner as well. Strong-smelling cleaners could cause your cat to mark again.
2. Make soiled areas inaccessible. This will block your cat from marking the same area again.

The black circle in the center of your eye is your pupil. It changes size thousands of times a day. When you're in dim light, it gets bigger to let more light in. When you're in bright light, it shrinks to protect your eye and keep light out.

When your pupil shrinks (constricts), it's called miosis. If your pupils stay small even in dim light, it can be a sign that things in your eye aren't working the way they should. This is called abnormal miosis, and it can happen in one or both of your eyes.

## Are Your Pupils Supposed to Be Small?

If you're in a bright environment, the pupil will shrink in size to allow less light to enter the eye. In dark surroundings, the [pupil](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-pupils-health) expands to let more light in. Your pupil's size can also change depending on whether you're looking at nearby or far-away objects. If the pupil doesn't vary in size in response to changes in lighting and gaze, there might be something wrong.

In an adult, the pupil's diameter usually varies between 2 and 4 millimeters in bright light and between 4 and 8 millimeters in dim light.

The maximum pupil size also varies significantly among age groups. For example, the pupil is the widest around age 15, after which it begins narrowing in an inconsistent fashion after age 25.

Pupil size can change dramatically in response to not only light but also your emotions, periods of intense concentration, recently eaten foods, prescription and recreational drugs, and underlying diseases or disorders. Past physical injuries to the [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes) or the head can also have a long-lasting impact on the average pupil size.

**Response to light.** Variations in lighting conditions are the most common reason for a change in pupil size. The pupils in both eyes respond independently to bright or dim light, so it's possible for one pupil to expand or contract while the other remains stable. Pupils also make small adjustments in size to help you focus better on a close or distant object.

**Emotions.** Processing or experiencing emotions leads to changing pupil sizes too. The pupils slightly expand or dilate every time you feel excited or nervous. Seeing strong emotional cues like a person laughing or crying could also cause differences in pupil size. In general, pupils tend to grow wider if you vividly feel a positive or negative emotion. The pupils can also widen if you're concentrating hard on a particular task like solving a math problem or retrieving a memory.

**Medications and drugs.** Both prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause your pupils to expand or contract. Your [ophthalmologist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-ophthalmologist) or eye doctor might give you eye drops that widen or dilate your pupils. This allows medical professionals to take a better look at your inner eye. Illegal or recreational drugs can also produce noticeable changes in pupil size. The most commonly abused drugs that affect pupil size include cocaine, LSD, MDMA, heroin, methamphetamine, and ketamine.

## Miosis Causes

**Age.** It's normal for a newborn's pupils to stay small for about 2 weeks so their eyes have extra protection from bright light. Your pupils tend to get smaller as you get older, too. The muscles that work your pupils can get weak and have a tough time opening them. This can make it harder for you to see at night.

**Inflammation.** [Swelling](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/remedies-to-relieve-swollen-eyelid) inside your eye can make it hard for your pupils to get bigger. Sometimes this happens if you've injured your eye. It may also be because of a condition called uveitis, which is swelling in your iris -- the part that gives your eye its color -- and the tissues around it.

**Side effect of a medication.** Certain anxiety, muscle spasm, and seizure medications like diazepam (Valium) or antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can make your pupils shrink. So can narcotics, either prescribed or illicit.

**Genes.** Being born without the muscle that controls your pupils or with pupil muscles that aren't formed correctly is called congenital miosis or microcoria. You get it when one or both of your parents pass down a problem gene to you. It can happen in one eye or both eyes. If you have it, you may also be nearsighted and have trouble seeing things far away. Or you may have [glaucoma](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/glaucoma-eyes), which means there's too much pressure inside your eyeball.

**Horner's syndrome.** This rare condition affects the way your brain "talks" to one side of your face, including one of your eyes. It can make one of your pupils smaller than the other. You can inherit it from your parents, or it can happen after a neck injury or neck surgery. You can also get it if your chest, neck, or brain doesn't form correctly. Sometimes kids get it if they have a rare type of cancer called [neuroblastoma](https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-neuroblastoma) or a tumor in another part of their body.

Horner's syndrome may cause no other symptoms, or you could have issues like:

- Droopy upper eyelid (ptosis)
- Raised lower eyelid
- Lighter eye color in the eye with [miosis](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye_miosis_facts)(heterochromia)
- Less sweat on the side of your face with the miotic eye

**Cluster headaches.** These headaches come on in groups -- or clusters -- before stopping. You can have up to eight headaches within a day, each lasting about 30 minutes. Like Horner’s syndrome, miosis and drooping may affect one side of your face.

Some other causes of miosis include:

- Neurosyphilis (a bacterial infection in your brain that comes from untreated syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease)
- Severe lack of vitamin D

## Miosis Diagnosis

To find out if you have abnormal miosis, your doctor will take a close look at your eyes in a dark room. They'll ask you to look at a faraway object. Then they'll check:

- The size and shape of your pupils
- The size of your [eyelid](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eyelid-problems-injuries) opening
- Whether your pupils are equal in size
- The position of your pupils
- How your pupils react to bright light

Normal pupils are 2 to 4 millimeters in bright light and 4 to 8 millimeters in the dark. Your doctor can measure your pupils in both eyes to see how well they shrink and grow.

Sometimes, your doctor may use drops that are supposed to make your pupils big to see how yours react. Or they may order images of your chest, brain, or neck to rule out signs of [Horner's syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/horner-syndrome).

## Miosis Treatment

Your doctor's recommendations will depend on what's causing your abnormal miosis. If a medication is to blame, they may be able to find a different option that solves the issue.

If your pupils are small because of inflammation in your eye, they can give you long-lasting dilating drops (atropine or homatropine) that make your pupils wider. These are a lot like the drops your [eye doctor](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/visit-eye-doctor) uses to dilate your eyes during an exam, but they can last up to 2 weeks.

If Horner's syndrome is causing it, they may need to do several tests to figure out how best to treat it.

Take a journey with us from the moment a single sperm fertilizes an egg. From tiny egg to growing embryo, follow the incredible process of conception.

Ovulation happens each month when a woman's ovaries release a mature egg. It happens about 2 weeks after the first day of their last menstrual period.

![Moving Into the Fallopian Tube](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/conception_slideshow/getty_rm_SEM_of_egg_sperm_in_fallopian_tube.jpg?resize=652px:*&output-quality=100)

**3**/9

After the egg is released from the ovary, it travels into the fallopian tube. It stays there until a single sperm fertilizes it.

![The Sperm's Long Journey](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/conception_slideshow/photolibrary_rf_photo_of_sperm_swimming.jpg?resize=652px:*&output-quality=100)

A man may ejaculate 40 million to 150 million sperm, which start swimming upstream toward the fallopian tubes on their mission to fertilize an egg. Fast-swimming sperm can reach the egg in a half an hour, while others may take days. The sperm can live up to 48-72 hours. Only a few hundred will even come close to the egg because of the many natural barriers that exist in a woman's body.

**5**/9

It takes about 24 hours for a sperm cell to fertilize an egg. When the sperm penetrates the egg, the surface of the egg changes so that no other sperm can enter. At the moment of fertilization, the baby's genetic makeup is complete, including whether it's a boy or girl.

The fertilized egg starts growing fast, dividing into many cells. It leaves the fallopian tube and enters the uterus 3 to 4 days after fertilization. In rare cases, the fertilized egg attaches to the fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy and is a danger to the mother.

**7**/9

After it gets to the uterus, the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. This process is known as implantation. The cells keep dividing.

**8**/9

Within about a week of conception, a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can be found in the mother's blood. It is produced by cells that will become the placenta. The hormone will show up on a blood or urine pregnancy test at the doctor's office. Some home tests can detect pregnancy on the first day of your missed period.

**9**/9

After the egg attaches to the uterus, some cells become the placenta while others become the embryo. The heart begins beating during week 5. The brain, spinal cord, heart, and other organs are beginning to form. At the eighth week the developing baby, now called a fetus, is well over a half-inch long -- and growing. A "full term" delivery generally happens around 40 weeks.

## What Are Dildos?

Dildos are sex toys that you can put into the mouth, anus, or vagina. While they are sometimes meant to feel like a penis, they don’t have to look like one [.](https://www.webmd.com/men/picture-of-the-penis#1) They come in different materials, shapes, and sizes. Some dildos are curved in order to stimulate the prostate or G-spot.

There are many kinds of dildos. You can find ones that are:

- Made to look like a penis with testicles
- Made to be strapped on with a harness
- Meant for two partners to use at once, called double-sided or double-penetration dildos
- Vibrating dildos
- Made with a suction base to adhere to a surface
- Glass or metal dildos

**Dildos in history**

Dildos have been around for centuries. Archeologists believe that the oldest one, unearthed in the Hohle Fels cave in Germany back in 2005, dates back more than 28,000 years. Ever since, dildos have been used in societies throughout history.

In ancient Greece, people made stuffed dildos out of leather, which men often gifted to their wives when they left to go to war. Meanwhile, during the Renaissance, members of the upper class had dildos custom-made from materials like silver and ivory.

Around the 17th century, dildos were a source of controversy. England passed laws that prevented women from making them, and later, America banned the sale of rubber dilators (medical devices that help stretch the vagina), leading to the creation of an underground sex toy market.

It wasn’t until the sexual revolution in the 1960s that dildos were, once again, widely accepted as tools for pleasure and sexual liberation.

## Benefits of Dildos

Dildos are popular with people of all genders and sexualities.

Sometimes they can have a medical purpose. Some sexual medicine experts recommend them as part of therapy for [vaginismus](https://www.webmd.com/women/vaginismus-causes-symptoms-treatments), or pelvic floor muscle spasms. Stretching the tissue in your vagina can make it more flexible and strengthen the pelvic floor, making penetration easier.

Dildos can provide internal stimulation to the G-spot (a sexually sensitive area in the vagina), prostate, or other parts of the vagina or anus. If you’re sexually aroused, your body releases the feel-good hormones dopamine and oxytocin. Masturbation, whether on your own or with a partner, can help you feel less stressed, sleep better, improve your focus, put you in a better mood, and even prevent [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/anxiety-disorders).

Dildos can also play a psychological role in arousal and sex play. For couples, that might mean trying out new sensations or dynamics in the bedroom.

## What’s the Difference Between Dildos and Vibrators?

Dildos and vibrators are both sex toys, and there’s a fair amount of overlap between their functions. The biggest difference is that not all dildos can vibrate, though some do.

Some vibrators are designed to be used externally during solo or partner play, and others are made to be put into the vagina or anus.

## Myths about Dildos

A common myth is that dildos are only for single people. But you can use them solo or with a partner.

Some people worry when their partner wants to use a dildo. They fear that it means their partner is sexually dissatisfied or that the dildo will replace them sexually.

But studies on the use of sex toys have found that they can aid sexual relationships between committed couples. In relationships marked by open communication, sex toys may enhance sexual experiences and intimacy.

## How to Try Dildos Safely

If you’re choosing and using your first dildo, there are a few things to keep in mind so you can have a safe and comfortable experience:

- Choose a dildo made with non-porous materials such as body-safe silicone, glass, or metal. Keep in mind that the FDA doesn't regulate most products sold as sex toys, so pay attention to the advertising and online reviews, or get recommendations from an adult store. Something sold as "for novelty use only" may not be as body-safe and could contain plastics or chemicals you want to avoid.
- Unless you know you prefer a wide girth, start small and work your way up.
- Use plenty of lubricant, especially during anal play. Your anus doesn’t create its own lubrication, so using a dry dildo could cause the tissue to tear. This can be painful and raise your chances of getting an infection.
- Be sure the lubricant you're using is right for your toy – water-based lubricants work well with most dildos, but silicone-based lubricants can actually break down sex toys made out of silicone.
- If you’re using a dildo with multiple partners, you should put a new condom on it each time. Sex toys can pass on STDs, and condoms help protect you from getting them. Putting a condom on a dildo is similar to putting one on a penis: Place it on the top of the toy and unroll it so that it covers the entire base. If you’re using a dildo made from porous material, like PVC or rubber, it’s also a good idea to use condoms, since these toys absorb bacteria more easily and can spread infections.
- Wash your dildo after each use and between using it on different parts of your body.

If you feel any discomfort while using a dildo, stop. You may need more lubricant or a smaller size.

**Glass dildos**

Glass dildos are nontoxic, durable, and easy to clean. They’re made to be more resistant to breakage, which means they’re perfectly safe to use. Some people dislike glass dildos because they don’t flex the same as other materials, like silicone, which could make inserting them less comfortable. But since glass is temperature-sensitive, you have the option to warm it up or cool it down, which can create new sensations.

**Silicone dildos**

Silicone’s diversity as a material has made it one of the most popular choices for dildos: It's body-safe, smooth, it can be soft or firm, and it's easy to clean. If you have a silicone toy, you should avoid using silicone lubricant, since it can cause the material to break down and make it more difficult to sanitize. It’s also common for silicone dildos to contain a mix of other non-body-safe materials, so always try to choose one made with medical-grade silicone.

**Metal dildos**

Metal dildos made from stainless steel are also body-safe and easy to clean. They tend to be heavier than dildos made from other materials, which makes them a better choice if you enjoy more intense stimulation. Similar to glass, metal dildos don't flex, so they might be less comfortable for some people. But, they are temperature sensitive and can be used with all types of [lubricant](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/what-to-know-about-fertility-and-lubricants).

## How to Clean a Dildo

How best to clean your dildo depends on what material it’s made from and whether it has electronic parts that can’t get wet.

- You can put some glass, steel, and silicone dildos in the dishwasher, as long as they’re not battery-operated or rechargeable.
- Stainless steel dildos can soak in a 10% bleach/water solution for up to 10 minutes.
- For silicone dildos without a vibrating function, you can put them in boiling water for 5-10 minutes.
- Dildos made of hard plastic shouldn't be boiled, but you can wash them with antibacterial soap and water.

Almost all sex toys can be cleaned by hand with soap and warm water. For the best results, follow the dildo maker's instructions on the best way to clean it.

**How to store it**

After cleaning and drying your dildo, place it in its individual storage container or bag. It’s best to keep dildos and other sex toys in a cool, dry place. Toys made from porous materials should especially be kept away from heat, humidity, and sunlight.

## Takeaways

Dildos are made for all sorts of tastes and needs, including sexual exploration, pleasure, and therapeutic purposes. When selecting a dildo that’s best for you, you should consider the material, shape, and size. Proper care and usage are important for a safe and enjoyable experience.

## Dildo FAQs

**What materials are dildos made of?**

Body-safe dildos are made from glass, stainless steel, or medical-grade silicone. Dildos can also be made from plastic, rubber, leather or vinyl, but these materials can contain chemicals you don't want in your body and are usually harder to clean properly.

**How long do dildos last?**

How long your dildo will last depends on what it's made of, how often you use it, and how you take care of it. High-quality sex toys made from more durable materials, like silicone or glass, can last a lifetime with proper care. If you see signs of wear and tear, it's best to replace your dildo to avoid the risk of infection.

**Do I need a specific size?**

If you’ve never tried a dildo, start with a smaller size and work your way up to larger ones from there. In a study published in 2015 on dildos and [vibrators](https://www.webmd.com/sex/what-are-vibrators) sold by sex toy makers, the typical size sold was between 4 and 6 inches in length and between 4 and 5 inches in circumference. Always choose a dildo that feels comfortable for you.

Oranges are a staple in many kitchens. This round, citrus fruit is found in fruit bowls, refrigerators, and lunch boxes across the United States. Yes, you've seen and most likely eaten an orange or two, but do you know just how beneficial they are for your body?

## Health Benefits

Oranges are a nutritional powerhouse, packed with vitamins and minerals. The most noteworthy of these is vitamin C, a water-soluble antioxidant that prevents cell damage.

How does it work? Every cell in the body contains DNA, which is vulnerable to damage, or mutations, when exposed to free radicals. When DNA mutates, it can lead to the growth of cancerous cells. Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals and can prevent this mutation.

The vitamin C found in oranges has other health benefits too:

- Forms blood vessels, muscles, cartilage, and collagen in your bones.
- Fights inflammation and can reduce the severity of conditions like asthma, [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-basics), and [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/chemotherapy-what-to-expect).
- Boosts the body's immune system to protect against viruses and germs.
- Improves iron absorption and fights [anemia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics).
- Slows age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which can lead to vision loss.
- Lowers blood pressure and cortisol, the stress hormone.

In addition to vitamin C, oranges have other nutrients that keep your body healthy.

**Fiber**

The fiber in oranges can keep blood sugar levels in check and reduce high [cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/understanding-numbers) to prevent cardiovascular disease.

**Calcium**

Oranges contain approximately 55 milligrams of calcium, or 6% of your daily requirement. This nutrient is important for building strong bones and maintaining bone health. It's typically associated with dairy products like [milk](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-milk)— but whole vegetables and fruits, like oranges, are also a good source.

**Folic Acid or Folate**

Folic acid is an essential B vitamin the body uses to create DNA and divide cells. If you don't have enough folate in your diet, it can lead to blood disease, cancer, and even birth defects. If you're pregnant, have an orange. It's a great natural source of folate.

**Natural Sugar**

This type of sugar is found in whole foods like milk, vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes. Unlike processed sugar that you'd find in candy, natural sugar contains fewer calories and more nutritional benefits.

**Potassium**

Oranges are high in potassium, a mineral that regulates heartbeat and muscle function. It's been shown to lower blood pressure in people with hypertension.

**Citric Acid**

A sour compound that's found in citrus fruits, citric acid is also used as a natural preservative. Oranges have plenty of it, and it can alter pH levels in the urine and prevent the formation of calcium oxalate stones, or kidney stones.

## Nutrition

One orange contains 100% or more of the daily recommended amount of vitamin C, the highest of any citrus fruit:

- 60 calories
- 0 grams of fat
- 0 grams of sodium
- 12 grams of sugar
- 3 grams of fiber
- 1 gram of [protein](https://www.webmd.com/diet/high-protein-foods)
- 70 milligrams of vitamin C
- 14 micrograms of vitamin A
- 55 milligrams of calcium
- 237 milligrams of potassium
- 15.4 grams of carbohydrates

**Portion Sizes**

Oranges are a vitamin-packed and healthy food, but moderation is key. They have a high concentration of acid, which can be irritating to the stomach, especially if you have [gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)](https://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/reflux-disease-gerd-1).

Oranges are high in potassium, so if you're on beta-blockers, eating too many can lead to kidney damage. If you have a condition called hemochromatosis and your body stores excess iron, too much vitamin C can increase iron levels and lead to tissue damage.

If you prefer to drink your fruits, stick to one or two glasses of OJ a day. Juices are higher in sugar and lower in fiber. Excess sugar can lead to [weight gain](https://www.webmd.com/baby/weight-gain).

## How to Eat Oranges

Oranges are available at most grocery stores. They don't cost much, and they're a great snack — just peel and eat. Oranges can be stored at room [temperature](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/normal-body-temperature) on the kitchen counter or in a fruit bowl. If you don't eat them in a couple of days, put them in the fridge.

Raspberries are a small, sweet fruit with a tart undertone. Their cheerful pop of color and delicious flavor can make any ordinary meal feel special. And, each delicate raspberry is packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.

Raspberries can be found in four different colors: red, black, purple, and gold. Red raspberries are the most common type found at the grocery store. Fresh raspberries are generally available from June to October, but frozen raspberries are available year-round and contain the same amount of vitamins and minerals.

In addition, raspberries can also offer substantial health benefits.

## Health Benefits

Raspberries pack a lot of nutrition into a small space. They provide potassium, essential to heart function, and proven to lower [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/qa/what-is-blood-pressure). The omega-3 fatty acids in raspberries can help prevent [stroke](https://www.webmd.com/stroke/default.htm) and [heart disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/default.htm). They also contain a mineral called manganese, which is necessary for healthy bones and skin and helps regulate blood sugar.

**Diabetes Management**

One cup of raspberries provides 8 grams of fiber, far more than most fruits in the produce aisle. Fiber can help lower [blood sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/blood-sugar-glucose-directory), [cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/default.htm), and [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm). Foods high in fiber tend to be more satisfying and keep you feeling full longer after a meal, so they can help with weight management.

Raspberries contain much less sugar than most fruits — just 5 grams in an entire cup, making them less likely to raise your blood sugar levels.

Raspberries add a sweet taste to dishes, which can reduce your desire to sweeten food with artificial preservatives helping you [lose weight](https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/default.htm) and control your [blood sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20030604/diabetes-health-key-blood-sugar-control) levels.

**Disease Prevention**

Raspberries are high in antioxidants that can protect cells from damage by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable atoms that injure your cells as they try to stabilize. The damage they cause may play a role in the aging process, [arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/default.htm), cancer, [heart disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/default.htm), [Alzheimer’s disease](https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/default.htm), and many other conditions.

Antioxidants stabilize free radicals, making them harmless. Fresh raspberries are among the top sources of antioxidants for your diet. Black raspberries offer the most antioxidants, followed by red and then golden raspberries. The deeper the color, the more antioxidants the berry contains.

**Healthy Skin**

Raspberries also contain Vitamin C, which is vital to collagen production, a protein that makes up 75% of your skin. As you age, collagen decreases, causing wrinkles and sagging.

Raspberries are loaded with Vitamin C, which may also help prevent and repair skin damage from the sun.

## Nutrition

Fresh or frozen, raspberries are a great source of:

- [Fiber](https://www.webmd.com/diet/fiber-directory)
- [Vitamin C](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamin-c-directory)
- [Manganese](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/qa/what-does-manganese-do)
- [B vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/b-vitamins-directory)
- [Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/omega-3-fatty-acids-directory)
- [Potassium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/potassium-directory)

**Nutrients per Serving**

One cup of fresh red raspberries contains:

- Calories: 64
- [Protein](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/good-protein-sources): 1 gram
- [Fat](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/good-fat-bad-fat): >1 gram
- [Carbohydrates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-carbohydrates-overview): 14 grams
- [Fiber](https://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/fiber-how-much-do-you-need): 8 grams
- Sugar: 5 grams

**Things to Watch Out For**

Pre-mixed raspberry yogurt can contain up to 25 grams of carbohydrates and 18 grams of sugar per serving. Most brands add more sugar than raspberries. The same amount of plain Greek yogurt and ½ cup of raspberries provides almost double the amount of food with only 14 grams of carbs and less than 10 grams of sugar.

## How to Prepare Raspberries

Each of the four types of raspberries — red, black, purple, and gold — are distinct in taste. Black raspberries are sweet with a flavor somewhere between a red raspberry and a blackberry. Purple raspberries are a cross between the red and black. A golden raspberry is pale yellow and has a unique, mellow flavor described as a combination of honey, apricot, banana, and raspberry.

Try topping your oatmeal, pancakes, waffles, or cereal with raspberries. Use them to sweeten smoothies, muffins, or fruit salad. Or just enjoy a handful as a sweet and tart afternoon snack.

Here are a few ways to use raspberries in recipes:

- Sprinkle a handful of raspberries and granola on top of Greek yogurt to make a parfait.
- Preserve raspberries to make a sweet jam to spread on toast.
- Add raspberries to your favorite white chocolate cookie recipe.
- Spruce up your lemonade or iced tea with fresh or frozen raspberries.
- Bake overripe raspberries into a raspberry bread.
- Combine raspberries, brown sugar, flour, and butter to make a raspberry crumble.
- Spruce up your salad with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing.

## What Is Implantation Bleeding?

Implantation bleeding is light bleeding from the vagina that happens in some people 10 to 14 days after they conceive a baby.

You may think it’s just a light period, but it’s an early sign of pregnancy. It’s not dangerous, and you don’t need treatment.

But heavy bleeding (more than you’d have with a typical period) can be a sign of a problem. Call your doctor if you bleed a lot, with or without fever or chills, or have cramps that get worse.

![photo of](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/BigBead/implantation_vs_your_period_infographic_other/650x965_implantation_vs_your_period_infographic_bigbead.jpg)

**How common is implantation bleeding?**

Implantation bleeding is considered a normal part of pregnancy. About 25% of pregnant people will have it. Some people who do have it might not even notice it.

## When Does Implantation Bleeding Happen?

After a [sperm](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/sperm-and-semen-faq) fertilizes your egg, the combination becomes an embryo. It travels to your uterus, where it implants itself into the lining.

Sometimes, as the embryo attaches, it causes a little bleeding. This usually happens about the time you would have your period. You may even confuse it with your period and not realize you’re pregnant. Implantation bleeding is normal and doesn’t mean you or your baby will have problems.

## Implantation Bleeding Symptoms

Implantation bleeding tends to happen before you notice [morning sickness](https://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/Managing-morning-sickness). You might have:

- Blood that’s brown or pinkish
- Blood that’s lighter in flow and doesn’t last as long as your period
- Mild or no cramping

**Implantation bleeding color**

This bleeding doesn't look like your monthly period, which is bright red or dark red for most people. Implantation bleeding can range from light pink to brown or dark brown. And it's more like vaginal discharge than your regular period.

## How to Know It's Implantation Bleeding

It’s probably implantation bleeding if you have some of the other early signs of pregnancy, including:

- Tender, swollen breasts or nipples
-  Fatigue
-  Headache
-  Upset stomach
- Vomiting (morning sickness)
- [Food cravings](https://www.webmd.com/baby/the-truth-about-food-cravings) or aversions
- Mood swings
- Peeing more than usual

If you’re not sure whether you’re having implantation bleeding or your period, take a pregnancy test or talk to your doctor.

## How Long After Implantation Bleeding Can I Test?

Pregnancy tests you take at home check for a hormone called hCG in your pee. Your hCG level starts going up after the embryo implants in the wall of your uterus. If you take the test too early, you might get the wrong result. It's a good idea to test 3 to 6 days after the implantation bleeding (spotting) stops.

Your doctor might give you a blood test that checks for higher levels of [hCG](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-intact-human-chorionic-gonadotropin). It can find hCG much earlier.

## Implantation Bleeding vs. Period

Other than the color of the blood (pink or brownish vs. red or dark red), there are a few other differences between implantation bleeding and a regular period:

- **How long it lasts**: Implantation bleeding lasts 1-3 days. Your period normally lasts a week or so.
- **The amount of blood**: Implantation bleeding is really just spotting or a very light flow. For your period, you can use several pads and [tampons](https://www.webmd.com/women/how-to-insert-and-remove-tampons). It starts heavy and decreases as the days go on.
- **Cramping**: With implantation bleeding, you might get very mild cramps, if you get them at all. Cramping for your period can start a day or two before the bleeding starts, and the pain can be intense in some people.

**Can implantation bleeding be red?**

If your blood is red, it is probably your period or another issue.

**Does implantation bleeding have clots?**

Implantation bleeding usually doesn't have clots. Some people (but not all) have clots with their [regular periods](https://www.webmd.com/women/normal-period).

**Can implantation bleeding be heavy?**

Some people think it's a mistake to call it implantation "bleeding" because it is usually spotting or a very light flow at most. Regular periods can be quite heavy, soaking pads and tampons.

## How Long Does Implantation Bleeding Last?

Unlike most periods, it usually stops after 1 or 2 days.

## Implantation Bleeding Treatment

It will stop on its own. If you're worried that you've bled a lot, call your doctor. They may want to know how much blood you saw and what color it was.

## Other Causes of Bleeding During Pregnancy

Many things can cause bleeding when you're pregnant, some of them harmless and some serious. If you’re bleeding a lot, with or without pain or [cramping](https://www.webmd.com/baby/abdominal-pain-and-pregnancy-what-to-know) at any time, call your doctor.

If you’re pregnant and see blood in your underwear, it may be caused by:

**Sex**. Hormonal and physical changes may be to blame for this. It should stop on its own.

**Fibroids and polyps**. Your doctor might do some tests to check for these growths on your uterus.

**Cervical problems.** Conditions like infection or growths on your cervix can also cause bleeding.

**Infection.** Sexually transmitted diseases like trichomoniasis can cause light bleeding as well as more serious problems. Starting treatment as soon as possible will keep your baby healthy.

[**Ectopic pregnancy**](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-ectopic-pregnancy) **.** This is when an embryo implants outside your uterus. You may have bleeding with pain and cramps. It’s dangerous and needs medical care right away.

**Miscarriage.** About 15% of known pregnancies end during the first few months. Bleeding and cramping often happen afterward. Call your doctor right away if you know that you're pregnant and you have these symptoms.

## When to See a Doctor

Call your doctor if the bleeding doesn’t stop after a few days or if you’re worried about how much you are bleeding.

## Takeaways

Implantation bleeding happens after an embryo attaches to the wall of your uterus. It is spotting (very light bleeding) that lasts a day or so and is not nearly as heavy as a regular period.

- It's very common and stops on its own.
- One way to know it's implantation bleeding: You may have other early [symptoms of pregnancy](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-am-i-pregnant), such as tender breasts or morning sickness.
- Wait a few days after the spotting stops to do a home pregnancy test. Your doctor can do a blood test earlier than that to tell you whether you're pregnant.

## Implantation Bleeding FAQs

**Can you test positive during implantation bleeding?**

If you take a home [pregnancy test](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-tests) during your implantation bleeding, the result is more likely to be negative than positive (even if you _are_ pregnant). The test checks for the amount of the hormone hCG in your pee. But because your body doesn't start making more hCG until the embryo attaches to the uterus, if you take it too soon, the level would still be low. To get a correct result, it's best to wait until a few days after the implantation bleeding stops. If you want results earlier, talk to your doctor about a blood test. HCG will show up faster there.

**Can implantation bleeding last 5 days?**

Normally, implantation bleeding lasts a day or two. Sometimes it lasts only a few hours. It's rare for it to last more than 3 days. If what seems to be implantation bleeding does go on longer than that, it's probably not implantation bleeding. It might be your regular period or some other issue.

‌You may have heard toddlers mimic noises and words when they hear others speak. This repetition or imitation of sounds, phrases, or words is called echolalia. The term comes from the Greek words “echo” and “lalia,” which mean “to repeat speech”.

## Echolalia Definition

‌Echolalia is the repetition or echoing of words or sounds that you hear someone else say. It is an important step for language development in children. **‌**

Echolalia can also be a sign of autism or developmental disability in children or neurological problems in adults. These include a stroke or psychiatric disorders like [Tourette’s syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tourettes-syndrome#1).

## Causes of Echolalia

‌Children often learn to speak by repeating words that they hear. Echolalia is commonly seen in toddlers during the first 3 years. Echolalia can be a problem if it continues in children older than 3.

**Echolalia in children.** Echolalia is a sign of autism, developmental disability, or communication disability in children over the age of 3. **‌**

It can happen in children with [autism spectrum disorders](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm) like [Asperger’s syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome). They may need extra time to process the world around them and what people say to them. This causes them to copy or repeat the sounds or words they hear.

**Echolalia in adults.** You may find yourself repeating the same words you hear in a stressful situation. But you may also have echolalia with neurological or psychiatric problems including: ‌

- Language disorders like [aphasia](https://www.webmd.com/brain/aphasia-causes-symptoms-types-treatments)
- Head injury or trauma
- Neurodegenerative disorders
- Confusion or delirium
- Memory loss or [dementia](https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/types-dementia)
- Brain tissue inflammation or encephalitis
- Tourette’s syndrome
- Learning disability
- Paralysis
- [Schizophrenia](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/mental-health-schizophrenia)
- Stroke
- Epilepsy

## Symptoms of Echolalia

Repeating phrases, words, or noises that you hear others say is the main symptom of echolalia. It can also cause anxiety, irritability, or frustration while talking to someone.

## Types of Echolalia

Echolalia can be one of two types.

**Immediate echolalia.** This is when you repeat something almost right away. It can also happen with a slight delay while talking to someone.

**Delayed echolalia.** This type involves delayed repetition of words hours or days after hearing them. It is usually seen in people with autism spectrum disorders. **‌**

Echolalia is “unmitigated” when you repeat someone’s exact words. It can also be “mitigated” if you change them during repetition.‌

## Tests for Echolalia

A speech-language pathologist can identify echolalia as they talk to you. These therapists often test children with autism for echolalia through speech lessons.

The test will tell them where your case falls on a range from slight to severe repetition. Your therapist can identify the stage of echolalia and come up with the best treatment plan for you.

## Treatment of Echolalia

The treatment of echolalia depends on the cause of the condition. Professionals who treat it include:‌

- Speech-language pathologists
- Speech therapists
- Neurodevelopmental specialists
- Psychologists/psychiatrists
- Special educators

‌ **Speech therapy.** [Speech therapy](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/benefits-speech-therapy-autism) is an effective way to treat autism-related echolalia. A team of therapists observes you and identifies the reason for your echolalia. They then try to understand why you keep repeating words. They also listen to you and respond in a way you understand.

A speech-language pathologist plays a major role in treating autism-related echolalia. They use behavioral techniques, speech therapy, verbal and visual cues, learning methods, self-monitoring, and positive reinforcement.

‌ **Medication.** Your doctor may prescribe medications such as antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( [SSRIs](https://www.webmd.com/depression/ssris-myths-and-facts-about-antidepressants)) if your echolalia is caused by stress, anxiety, or a psychiatric disorder. They may also give you a specific medication if your echolalia is triggered by neurological conditions such as stroke or epilepsy.

Check with a speech therapist to improve language and communication skills if you or your child has echolalia. You can also try online self-training programs to learn to talk without repeating words. Reading vocabulary and finding different ways to communicate may help you overcome echolalia over time.

## What Is a Stye?

A [stye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/styes-causes-symptoms-treatment-prevention) is a red, hot, and tender bump on the outer (and sometimes inner) edge of your eyelid. It looks like a pimple or a [boil](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/boils). Also spelled "sty," this bump happens when old oil, dead skin cells, or old [bacteria](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/bacterial-and-viral-infections) block one of your oil glands. This blockage makes good conditions for bacteria to grow and cause an infection. A stye can be painful and may cause your eyelid to swell or tear up.

Styes should go away in a couple of days and shouldn't affect your vision. There are home remedies that can help relieve your [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/understanding-pain-management-chronic-pain) and discomfort in the meantime.

## Stye Remedies

Two things you can do at home may help get rid of your stye faster:

**Use a warm compress**

Heat can help the stye drain. Soak a clean cloth in warm water and then put it over your affected eye with your eye closed. Keep the compress on for 10-15 minutes and repeat the process two to four times a day.

**Baby shampoo for styes**

You can buy specially made eye cleansers, but you can also use [baby](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/forming-a-bond-with-your-baby-why-it-isnt-always-immediate) shampoo. This mild soap made for babies' sensitive [eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes) won't cause burning or irritation if it gets inside your eye. Mix a few drops of baby shampoo into warm water, then use a cotton swab to gently brush the solution onto your stye. Rinse well. Make sure to wash your hands well before touching or cleaning your eyes.

## When to See a Doctor for Stye Treatment

Most styes go away on their own. But sometimes, you may need medical attention. In general, call your doctor if your stye hurts or doesn't seem to be getting better after two days.

Other signs you need medical help are:

- The stye makes it hard to see
- It becomes very large or painful
- It forms a [blister](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blisters-basics) on your eyelid
- It bleeds
- Your eyelid gets crusty or scaly
- Your eye, or the entire eyelid, is red
- You're sensitive to light
- Your eye is tearing up
- The stye keeps coming [back](https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/tips-for-pain-relief)

Your doctor might treat you or they may refer you to an [ophthalmologist](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-doctors-optometrists-ophthalmologists) or a doctor who treats eye problems.

There are a few ways a doctor can help you treat a stye:

**Stye ointment.** The doctor might prescribe antibiotic ointment to put on your eyelid.

**Stye eye drops.** You also can treat a stubborn stye with antibiotic eye drops.

**Draining a stye.** If your stye doesn't go away, your doctor may make tiny cuts on it. These cuts will help drain pus from the stye.

**Oral [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-are-antibiotics).** To prevent the stye from spreading to the surrounding skin, or treat it if this has already happened, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics you can take by mouth. They also might prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection after draining a stye.

## Stye Self-Care

It's important to keep the stye clean and free of irritation while it heals. To do this, you should:

**Avoid touching the stye.** Except when you're cleaning it, you should leave your stye alone. Irritating it will make it worse.

**Wear glasses.** Although contact lenses don't cause styes, they can easily get contaminated with the bacteria associated with styes. For this reason, if you normally wear contact lenses, you should try to go without them until your stye heals. In the meantime, wear glasses if you have them. After your stye goes away, you should order new contacts.

**Avoid makeup.** While you're at it, you should temporarily stop using eye makeup, too. To prevent further irritation or infection, you'll want to keep the area around your stye clean and uncovered.

## Style Complications

Bacterial infections of the oil glands can cause styes. If the bacteria spread to the skin around the stye, it could lead to a skin infection called [cellulitis](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/cellulitis). The eye or eyelid might become red, warm, and painful. This is an emergency. If left untreated, the infection could harm your vision and cause life-threatening complications.

If you think you might have cellulitis, call your doctor immediately.

**What makes a stye worse?**

A tiny mite called Demodex can cause a skin condition called [blepharitis](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/blepharitis). This can make you more likely to get styes. It also may make your styes worse.

Other things than can irritate or spread a stye are:

- Touching it
- Wearing contact lenses
- Wearing makeup

**Popping a stye**

Never try to pop, squeeze, or drain a stye on your own. This could cause bacteria to spread to the rest of your eye.

## Stye Prevention

The best way to prevent a stye is using proper eye hygiene. This means:

- Wash your hands often.
- Avoid touching and rubbing your eyes.
- Don't use old eye makeup. Avoid sharing makeup with others or wearing it overnight.
- Clean your eyelids with warm water and baby shampoo.
- If you use a warm washcloth to soothe a stye, clean it afterward.
- If you have blepharitis, treat it.

These simple steps will help keep the eyelid clean and free of bacteria and other irritants.

## Takeaways

A stye is a red, inflamed bump on your eyelid. Usually, it goes away on its own. Home remedies like holding a warm compress to your eye can help. If it doesn't start getting better within two days, call a doctor. They can drain it or prescribe antibiotic treatment.

## Stye Treatment FAQs

**What helps get rid of a stye fast?**

Holding a warm compress on your stye for 10-15 minutes a few times a day can help soothe a stye.

**Can I use [coconut oil](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1092/coconut-oil) for styes?**

Coconut oil has anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties, but so far, there's not a lot of evidence showing that it helps with styes.

**Do all styes need antibiotics?**

No. Most styes go away on their own.

**What causes a stye in your eye?**

Styes form when an oil gland becomes blocked and infected.

**Should you put a cold compress on a stye?**

You can treat styes at home with a warm compress.

**Can I use Neosporin on a stye?**

There is a special version of Neosporin (Neosporin Ophthalmic Ointment) that can treat eye infections, including blepharitis. This is different from the skin ointment.

**What is a stye**[**filled with**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sty/symptoms-causes/syc-20378017)**?**

Styes usually contain pus.

## What Is Erythritol?

Erythritol, a type of carbohydrate called sugar alcohol, is one of the most common artificial sweeteners available. It's popular in foods marketed for weight loss and diabetes. But research suggests that erythritol, and other artificial sweeteners, may have serious health risks—and may be worse for you than table sugar.

Erythritol is found naturally in some foods. It's also made when things like wine, beer, and cheese ferment. Besides its natural form, erythritol has also been a man-made sweetener since 1990.

**Calories in erythritol.** Sugar has 4 calories per gram but erythritol has zero. That's because your small intestine absorbs it quickly and gets it out of your body through urine within 24 hours. This means erythritol doesn't have a chance to "metabolize"—turn into energy in your body.

**Taste.** Erythritol tastes sweet. It's similar to table sugar.

**Appearance.** It's in the form of white crystal granules or powder.

## What Are the Dangers of Erythritol?

There's increasing scientific evidence that erythritol and other artificial sweeteners can be bad for your health. Recent research shows erythritol may be associated with an increased risk of [heart attack](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-disease-heart-attacks), stroke, and even death.

But erythritol is on the list of "Generally Recognized as Safe" foods by the FDA. So, long-term safety studies of erythritol aren't required currently. It means food makers don't have to list erythritol on product nutrition labels.

Experts note that the FDA considers erythritol safe because it's naturally occurring. But they say the quantities of erythritol that are used in food are much higher than what is known to be safe for your body. More research is needed to further understand  possible health risks of erythritol.

**Other side effects of erythritol**

In addition to increasing your risk of heart attack and stroke, erythritol can cause mild to severe digestive issues if you consume large amounts of it. That includes bloating, cramping, excess gas, and diarrhea.

**Benefits of erythritol.** Erythritol has no effect on your glucose or insulin levels. It also tastes as lot like table sugar. For decades, it's been a favorite artificial sweetener for those with diabetes.

**OK for your teeth.** In most cases, bacteria in your mouth break down regular sugars and starches and turn them into acid. This can wear down your enamel and cause cavities. But the FDA says erythritol is good for oral health because it slows the growth of one type of that bacteria and decreases the acid that bacteria make.

## How Erythritol Is Used

Erythritol is a common replacement for table sugar. It's found in many [low-calorie](https://www.webmd.com/diet/low-calorie-diets) and low-sugar products. It's also used to "bulk up" some other artificial sweeteners.

It's popular because it's low in calories, and it tastes and feels almost like table sugar. It's added to some sugar substitutes that are sold as "natural" alternatives to sugar. Sugar-free products that have erythritol might be recommended if you have obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome.

## Erythritol Products

Erythritol is commonly added to sugar substitutes marketed as "natural" alternatives to sugar, including stevia and monk fruit sweeteners. That includes products like Truvia and Splenda Naturals Stevia. Sugar-free products that contain erythritol might not say on their nutrition labels whether they include erythritol or other sugar alcohols.

Erythritol is common in sugar-free varieties of ice cream, candy, gum, cookies, cakes, protein bars, and fruit spreads. You can find erythritol with other sugar substitutes in stores and online. It's also sold in bulk to companies that use it to sweeten or thicken products like reduced-calorie and sugar-free foods and drinks.

**How do you know if your food contains erythritol?**

While food labels aren't required to list erythritol as an ingredient, there are some hints it might be in your food. If the package has these words, it may mean your food contains erythritol:

- Contains [sugar alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-are-sugar-alcohols)
- Keto-safe
- Diabetes-safe
- No sugar
- Low sugar
- Artificially sweetened
- Naturally sweetened
- Sweetened with natural compounds
- Low calorie
- No calories

**Safe alternatives to erythritol**

The best way to avoid erythritol is to focus on whole foods—those that are natural and nonpackaged, like fresh fruits and vegetables. If you want sweetener, experts say to stick with moderate amounts of table sugar or honey.

## Takeaways

- Erythritol is one of the most common artificial sweeteners available.
- Research shows erythritol may have serious health risks.
- Erythritol may be worse for you than table sugar.
- Erythritol is popular because it's low in calories and tastes like table sugar.
- Food companies aren't required to list erythritol on food labels.
- Erythritol is common in sugar-free varieties of ice cream, candy, gum, cookies, cakes, protein bars, and fruit spreads.

## Erythritol FAQs

**Is erythritol good or bad for you?**

While erythritol is popular in foods marketed for weight loss and [diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-basics), there's increasing research associating it with increased risks for serious health issues.

**Is erythritol safer than sugar?**

Experts say erythritol may be worse for you than table sugar.

**Are stevia and erythritol the same thing?**

They're not the same thing. Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that tastes a lot like table sugar. Stevia is a natural plant-based sweetener that's 300 times sweeter than sugar.

For most people, beauty products are a quick, simple way to look great. But if you notice that you have [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin) reactions -- like irritation, [rashes](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/common-rashes), or allergies -- to certain ingredients, these tips can help you steer clear.

**1\. Check the label.** Look for products with the fewest ingredients. This will make a bad reaction less likely.

**2\. Do a patch test first.** Before you start to use a new product, place a small amount on the inside of your elbow and wait 48 to 72 hours. If you notice no redness, swelling, [itching](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-pruritus), or burning on that spot, it’s OK for you to use.

**3\. Spritz the smart way.** Always put fragrance on your clothes, not your skin. You’ll be less likely to have a skin reaction to it. It also helps prevent the fragrance from having a bad reaction with other products you use.

**4\. Be true to yourself.** See how your skin responds. The labels "hypoallergenic," "dermatologist tested," "sensitivity tested," or "non-irritating" don't guarantee that your skin won't react.

**5\. Stop and soothe.** If your skin reacts badly to a [beauty](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-skin-and-health) product, stop using it immediately. You can sometimes use an over-the-counter [hydrocortisone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-148380/anti-itch+(hydrocortisone)+topical/details) cream to help ease [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation). In some cases, you might need a prescription-strength cream.

## Top 2 Skin Reactions to Beauty Products

**1\. Irritation.** Your doctor may call this “irritant [contact dermatitis](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/skin-allergies).” It’s the most common skin reaction to a [beauty](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/default.htm) product. It can cause burning, stinging, [itching](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/cm/rm-itch-quiz), and redness in the area where you apply the product.

If your skin is dry or injured, it loses some of its natural protection against irritants. This means reactions can be harsher or happen more easily.

**2\. Skin allergies (allergic contact dermatitis).** Sensitivity or a true [allergy](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergy-test-facts) to a specific ingredient in the product causes redness, swelling, itching, or [blisters](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blisters-basics) on the skin. Fragrances and preservatives are some of the biggest culprits.

Even products that say they're unscented could contain a “masking agent,” which is a fragrance that covers up chemical scents. Though you may not smell it, it still could be there and cause an [allergic reaction](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergic-reaction-causes) in some people.

To make sure no perfume is included, look for products marked “fragrance-free” or “without perfume.”

Preservatives are in almost every product that contains water. They need to be there, so it doesn’t spoil. All of the most common preservatives have been linked to skin allergies. But that doesn't mean they cause allergic reactions in everyone. They might not bother your skin at all.

## Beauty Products Most Likely to Cause a Skin Reaction

These include:

- Bath soaps
- Detergents
- Antiperspirants
- [Eye makeup](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/ss/slideshow-beautiful-eye-secrets)
- Moisturizers
- Permanent wave lotion (particularly those containing the chemical glyceryl monothioglycolate)
- Shampoos
- Long-wearing lip stains
- Nail polish (particularly those containing [formaldehyde](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-9987/formaldehyde+topical/details))
- Fingernail glue containing methacrylate

[Hair](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics) dyes can also be the source of skin reactions, especially those containing p-phenylenediamine as well as ammonium persulfate used to lighten [hair](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cm/rm-quiz-hair-care).

Also, beauty products containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) may cause problems -- such as redness, swelling, [blisters](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-blisters), [rash](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-irritants), or itch -- for some people. It’s more likely with strong products, which have a concentration of AHAs over 10% or with a pH (acid level) of 3.5 or less.

For some people, [tretinoin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3956/tretinoin+topical/details) wrinkle creams and serums can cause irritant contact dermatitis.

Many people are sensitive to [sunscreen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-366/sunscreen+topical/details). If that's true for you, talk to a dermatologist about how to best protect your skin from the sun. Look for sunscreens with very few ingredients and that are physical blockers (made with zinc oxide and/or [titanium dioxide](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-63608/titanium+dioxide+topical/details)), which usually don’t cause allergic reactions.

## What Is Niacin?

Once upon a time, scientists thought there was only one B vitamin. Today we know that there are eight B vitamins -- each with special functions that help your body work properly. [Vitamin B3](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-924-niacin+and+niacinamide+vitamin+b3.aspx?activeingredientid=924&activeingredientname=niacin+and+niacinamide+(vitamin+b3)) is also known as niacin. Having enough [niacin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-58189/b-3+niacin+oral/details) in the body is important for general good health because your body uses it to turn food into energy. B3 is also essential for the health of your nervous system, digestive system, and skin.

We typically get enough niacin from the foods we eat, including red meat, poultry, fish, brown rice, nuts, seeds, legumes, and bananas. Many cereals and breads also have niacin added.

In higher amounts, niacin may be recommended as a dietary supplement to improve [cholesterol levels](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/understanding-numbers), slow the progression of certain types of heart disease, and even help prevent memory loss and dementia. However, we are continuing to learn about the risks of excess niacin and how it may impact the body.

**Niacin vs. niacinamide**

Although the names sound similar, niacin and niacinamide are not the same. Niacinamide is a form of niacin that is made when you have an excess of niacin in your body. As a supplement, niacinamide is often found in products that protect and nourish the skin or treat acne.

## Niacin Benefits

In the early 20th century, scientists discovered that people with [niacin deficiency](https://www.webmd.com/diet/niacin-deficiency-symptoms-and-treatments) could develop a serious skin condition called pellagra. Thanks to this breakthrough in understanding the role of B vitamins and health, pellagra is now a rare condition, and niacin is an FDA-approved treatment. Over the years, researchers have continued to claim a variety of health benefits related to taking niacin.

**Niacin for high cholesterol**

As a cholesterol treatment, studies show that niacin can boost levels of good HDL cholesterol and lower [triglycerides](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/lowering-triglyceride-levels). Niacin also modestly lowers bad [LDL cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ldl-cholesterol-the-bad-cholesterol). It's sometimes prescribed in combination with [statins](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/side-effects-of-statin-drugs) for cholesterol control, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin ( [Lescol](https://www.webmd.com/search/search_results/default.aspx?query=lescol)), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor, Ezallor), and simvastatin (Flolipid, Zocor).

However, niacin is only effective as a [cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/video/bernstein-test-cholesterol-levels) treatment at fairly high doses. These doses could pose risks, such as liver damage, gastrointestinal problems, or glucose intolerance. Most recently, researchers found a link between excess niacin and heart disease. So don't treat yourself with over-the-counter niacin [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/diet/vitamin-supplement-glossary). Instead, get advice from your health care professional, who can prescribe FDA-approved doses of niacin instead if recommended.

**Niacin for blood pressure**

Because of niacin's positive effects on cholesterol levels, there have been numerous studies about how niacin may reduce high blood pressure. Until recently, the association between niacin intake and high blood pressure risk was unknown. However, a 2021 study in Chinese adults found a distinct relationship in the increase in dietary niacin with a decrease in blood pressure levels among people with new-onset hypertension.

## Niacin Dosage

Everyone needs a certain amount of niacin from food or supplements for the body to function normally. This amount is called the dietary reference intake (DRI), a term that is replacing the older and more familiar RDA (recommended dietary allowance). For niacin, the DRIs vary with age and other factors and are given in milligrams of niacin equivalents:

- Children: 2-16 milligrams daily, depending on age
- Men, or those assigned male at birth (AMAB): 16 milligrams daily
- Women, or those assigned female at birth (AFAB): 14 milligrams daily
- If pregnant: 18 milligrams daily
- If [breastfeeding](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nursing-basics): 17 milligrams daily
- Maximum daily intake for adults of all ages: 35 milligrams daily

Most people can get the niacin they need by eating a healthy diet. If your doctor prescribes niacin, you might want to take it with food. This can prevent upset stomach.

To reduce flushing -- a harmless but uncomfortable side effect of niacin that describes redness and warmth in the face and neck -- your doctor might recommend taking niacin along with [aspirin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-3-ASPIRIN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=1082&drugname=Aspirin+Oral) and avoiding alcohol and spicy foods.

Since niacin can be used in different ways, talk to your doctor about the best dosage for you.

## Niacin Overdose

Although niacin is essential for the body, too much of a good thing may cause health issues. You can't overdose by eating too many niacin-rich foods, but taking too much prescription or over-the-counter niacin can be dangerous. For example, a dose between 2,000 and 6,000 milligrams of niacin a day can cause serious side effects.

Symptoms of a niacin overdose include:

- Rapid heartbeat
- Severe skin flushing along with dizziness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Abdominal pain
- Itching
- Rash
- Gout

Get medical help immediately if you think you've had too much niacin.

## Niacin Foods

Niacin occurs naturally in many foods, including greens, meat, poultry, fish, and eggs, although in a fraction of the dose shown to achieve changes in cholesterol. Many products are also fortified with niacin during manufacturing. Good sources for niacin in a typical diet include:

- Fortified breads and cereals
- Red meat: Beef, beef liver, pork
- Poultry
- Fish
- Bananas
- Brown rice
- Legumes
- Nuts
- Seeds

## Side Effects of Niacin

**Skin flushing.** Niacin can cause flushing, usually around your face and neck, especially when you first begin taking it. Your doctor will probably suggest increasing the dose slowly to reduce this problem. They might also offer a time-release prescription formulation to control flushing.

**Gastrointestinal issues.** Niacin can cause [upset stomach](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-nausea-vomiting) and [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea). However, all of these side effects tend to fade over time.

**Other health risks.** Niacin does have risks. It can cause [liver](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/ss/slideshow-surprising-liver-damage) problems, stomach ulcers, changes to glucose levels, muscle damage, [low blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/heart/understanding-low-blood-pressure-basics), heart rhythm changes, and other issues. A study published in 2024 found a link between excess niacin and heart disease. Researchers discovered that when the body breaks down niacin, inflammation that damages blood vessels can happen.

People with any health condition including liver or [kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information), diabetes, high blood pressure, or cardiovascular problems need to talk to a doctor before using niacin [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/lamm-supplements-diet). Don't treat high cholesterol on your own with over-the-counter niacin supplements.

**Interactions.** If you take any medicines or supplements regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using niacin supplements. They could interact with medicines like diabetes drugs, [blood thinners](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ss/slideshow-tips-for-taking-blood-thinners), anticonvulsants, blood pressure medicines, thyroid hormones, and antibiotics as well as supplements like [ginkgo biloba](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-guide-ginkgo-biloba) and some antioxidants. Alcohol might increase the risk of liver problems. Though niacin is often used along with [statins](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/video/should-i-take-a-statin) for high cholesterol, this combination may increase the risk for side effects. Get advice from your health care professional.

At the low DRI doses, niacin is safe for everyone. However, at the higher amounts used to treat medical conditions, it can have risks. For that reason, children and anyone who is pregnant or [breastfeeding](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nursing-basics) shouldn't take niacin supplements in excess of the DRI unless it's recommended by a doctor.

People with uncontrolled gout also shouldn't take niacin supplements.

## Niacin and Pregnancy

For decades, women who may become pregnant have been advised to take supplements containing vitamin B9 (folic acid) in order to reduce the chance of certain birth defects. Recent research indicates that a lack of niacin may also impact the development of healthy babies. Niacin supplements may be taken during pregnancy and breastfeeding if there's a B3 deficiency; however, experts advise against taking prescription niacin for the treatment of high cholesterol if you're pregnant. Always talk with your doctor before taking niacin supplements if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.

## Takeaways

Niacin (vitamin B3) is essential to your health. Although you typically get niacin from the foods you eat, not getting enough can lead to serious conditions. Vitamin B3 has been used as a supplement to lower cholesterol and the risk of certain types of heart disease. It may also have an impact on high blood pressure. You can overdose on over-the-counter or prescription niacin, however. And new research indicates that extra niacin in the body may contribute to heart disease. You should always talk to your doctor before taking niacin supplements, especially if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.

## Niacin FAQs

**What does taking niacin do for your body?**

Having enough [niacin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-58189/b-3+niacin+oral/details) in the body is important for general good health because your body uses it to turn food into energy. B3 is also essential for keeping your nervous system, digestive system, and skin healthy. In higher amounts, niacin may also be used as a dietary supplement to improve [cholesterol levels](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/understanding-numbers), slow the progression of certain types of heart disease, and may even help prevent memory loss and dementia.

**Is it OK to take niacin daily?**

At the low dietary reference intake (DRI) doses, niacin is safe for everyone. However, at the higher amounts used to treat medical conditions, it can have risks. For that reason, children and those who are pregnant or [breastfeeding](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/breastfeeding-14/slideshow-breastfeeding) should not take niacin supplements in excess of the DRI unless it's recommended by a doctor.

People with any health condition including uncontrolled gout, [liver](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/cm/rmq-know-your-liver) or [kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information), diabetes, high blood pressure, or cardiovascular problems need to talk to a doctor before using niacin [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/lamm-supplements-diet). Don't treat high cholesterol on your own with over-the-counter niacin supplements.

**Why is niacin no longer recommended?**

We are continuing to learn about how niacin affects the body. A study published in 2024 found a link between excess niacin and heart disease. Researchers discovered that when the body breaks down niacin, inflammation that damages blood vessels can happen.

## What Is Gestational Diabetes?

Gestational diabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar levels become high during pregnancy. It affects pregnant people who have never been diagnosed with diabetes.

There are two classes of gestational diabetes. Those with class A1 can manage it through diet and exercise. Those who have class A2 need to take insulin or other medications.

Gestational diabetes goes away after you give birth. But it can affect your baby’s health, and it raises your odds of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. You can take steps so you and your baby stay healthy.

**How common is gestational diabetes?**

Gestational diabetes affects up to 10% of pregnancies in the U.S. each year.

## Gestational Diabetes Symptoms

If you have gestational diabetes, you usually don’t have symptoms or might blame them on [pregnancy](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-am-i-pregnant). Most find out that they have it during a routine screening.

You may notice that:

- You’re thirstier than usual.
- You’re hungrier and eat more than usual.
- You pee more than usual.

## Normal Blood Sugar Levels During Pregnancy

![infographic on target blood sugar levels](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/target_blood_sugar_levels_for_pregnant_women_graphic_other/1800x1200_target_blood_sugar_levels_for_pregnant_women_graphic_other.jpg)

The American Diabetes Association recommends these targets for pregnant women who test their blood sugar:

- Before a meal: 95 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) or less
- 1 hour after a meal: 140 mg/dL or less
- 2 hours after a meal: 120 mg/dL or less

## Gestational Diabetes Causes

When you eat, your pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps move a sugar called glucose from your blood to your cells, which use it for energy.

During pregnancy, your placenta makes hormones that cause glucose to build up in your blood. Usually, your pancreas can send out enough insulin to handle it. But if your body can’t make enough insulin or stops using insulin as it should, your [blood sugar levels](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes) rise, and you get gestational diabetes.

## Gestational Diabetes Risk Factors

You’re more likely to get gestational diabetes if you:

- Were overweight before you got pregnant
- Are Black, Asian, Hispanic or Latinx, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, or Native American
- Have blood sugar levels that are higher than they should be but not high enough to be diabetes (this is called prediabetes)
- Have a family member with diabetes
- Have had gestational diabetes before
- Have [polycystic ovary syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-pcos) (PCOS) or another health condition linked to problems with insulin
- Have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, or other medical complications
- Have given birth to a large baby (weighing more than 9 pounds)
- Have had a miscarriage
- Have given birth to a baby who was stillborn or had certain birth defects
- Are older than 25

## Gestational Diabetes Diagnosis

Gestational diabetes usually happens in the second half of pregnancy.

**When do they test for gestational diabetes?**

Your doctor will check for it between weeks 24 and 28, or sooner if you're at high risk.

**Gestational diabetes test**

Your doctor will give you a [glucose tolerance test](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/oral-glucose-tolerance-test). For the test, you’ll drink 50 grams of glucose in a sweet drink, which will raise your blood sugar. An hour later, you’ll take a blood glucose test to see how your body handled all that sugar. If the results show that your blood sugar is higher than a certain level, you’ll need a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, you’ll take a blood glucose test after you have fasted for at least 8 hours (your doctor’s office will tell you exactly how long to fast for) and then drink a beverage containing 100 grams of glucose. After that, you’ll take a blood glucose test every hour for the next 3 hours. Your doctor can also test you by having you fast for at least 8 hours, take a blood glucose test, drink a drink containing 75 grams of glucose, and then take a [blood glucose test](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-test-blood-glucose) once an hour for the next 2 hours.

**Gestational diabetes range**

A high blood sugar level is above 130-140 mg/dL (7.2-7.7 mmol/L). If it's higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), then it's likely that you have gestational diabetes.

If you’re at high risk but your test results are normal, your doctor might test you again later in your pregnancy to make sure you still don’t have it.

## Gestational Diabetes Treatment

If you have gestational diabetes, you’ll need treatment as soon as possible to keep yourself and your baby healthy during your pregnancy and delivery. Your doctor will ask you to:

- Check your blood sugar levels four or more times a day
- Check your urine for [ketones](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/ketones-and-their-tests), chemicals that mean that your diabetes isn’t under control
- Eat healthy foods
- Make exercise a habit

Your doctor will keep track of your weight and your baby’s development. They might give you insulin or another medicine to keep your blood sugar under control.

## Gestational Diabetes Complications

If you have gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of complications. They include:

**Needing a C-section.** Since your baby might be larger than normal, you may need a C-section, or surgery to deliver your baby through your belly.

**Hypoglycemia.** Also called low blood sugar, this condition can happen when you take insulin or other medicine to control your diabetes. Both you and your baby can get [hypoglycemia](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-hypoglycemia).

**Preeclampsia.**If you have high blood pressure, protein in your pee, and constant swelling in your fingers and toes, it could indicate preeclampsia. It's a serious condition requiring close tracking by a doctor. Preeclampsia can be dangerous for both you and your unborn child. It can lead to your baby being born early and raise your chances of seizures or stroke during labor. If you have diabetes, you're more prone to high blood pressure than those without diabetes.

## Gestational Diabetes Diet

Take these simple steps to stay well:

**Eat a healthy, low-sugar diet.** Talk to your doctor to be sure you’re getting the nutrition you need. Follow a meal plan made for someone with [diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/understanding-diabetes-symptoms):

- Trade sugary snacks such as cookies, candy, and ice cream for natural sugars such as fruits, carrots, and raisins. Add vegetables and whole grains, and watch your portion sizes.
- Have three small meals along with two or three snacks at about the same times every day.
- Get 40% of your daily calories from carbs, 20% from protein, and 25%-40% from fats. Most of the carbs should be complex and rich in fiber.
- Aim for 20-35 grams of fiber a day. Foods such as whole-grain breads, cereals, and pasta; brown or wild rice; oatmeal; and vegetables and fruits will help get you there.
- Limit your total fat to less than 40% of your daily calories. Saturated fat should be less than 10% of all the calories you eat.
- Eat a variety of foods to make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals. You may need to take a [supplement](https://www.webmd.com/diet/how-to-evaluate-vitamins-supplements) to cover your bases. Ask your doctor if they think you should take one.

**Gestational diabetes breakfast ideas**

Here are a few breakfast ideas if you have gestational diabetes:

- A bowl of oatmeal made with water or skim milk
- Two slices of whole-grain toast with unsaturated low-fat spread or cream cheese
- A boiled or poached egg
- Yogurt and nuts

**Gestational diabetes snacks**

For a snack, you can try:

- Greek yogurt topped with nuts, seeds, or fruit
- Unsalted nuts or seeds

**Get the right prenatal care:** Your doctor can check to see if you have gestational diabetes and offer advice on food, activity, and weight loss. They can also point you to other health professionals, such as [nutritionists](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/nutritionist-dietitian-choose), that can help.

**If you have morning sickness, eat small snacks.** Nibble on crackers, cereal, or pretzels before you get out of bed. As you go through your day, have small meals often and avoid fatty, fried, and greasy foods.

**If you take insulin, make sure you've got a plan to deal with low blood sugar.** Throwing up can lower your glucose level. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure what to do.

## Gestational Diabetes Exercise

**Exercise throughout your pregnancy.** You can exercise when you have gestational diabetes as long as your doctor says it’s OK. Being active is a good way to help manage your blood sugar. Staying fit during pregnancy is also good for your posture and can curb some common problems, such as backaches and fatigue.

- Get active as soon as possible. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week. Running, walking, swimming, and biking are good options. If you are not active now, start slowly and build up to 30 minutes a day.
- Was there a workout that you were doing before you found out you were pregnant? Do you have an activity that you love? Check with your doctor to see if you can keep it up, if you should make some changes, or if it's better to try something else.
- Exercise can lower your blood sugar. So, always have a form of quick sugar with you, such as glucose tabletsor hard candy, when you work out.

## How to Prevent Gestational Diabetes

You can lower your chances before you get pregnant by:

- Eating nutritious foods
- Staying active
- Losing extra weight

## Gestational Diabetes Effects on Babies

Your baby will probably be healthy if you and your doctor manage your blood sugar while you have gestational diabetes.

Right after you give birth, doctors will check your newborn's blood sugar level. If it’s low, your baby may need to get glucose through an IV until it gets back to normal.

Gestational diabetes raises the chance that your baby will be larger than normal. It's also linked to jaundice, in which the skin looks yellowish. [Jaundice](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/jaundice-why-happens-adults) generally fades quickly with treatment.

Although your child will be more likely than other kids to get type 2 diabetes later on, a healthy lifestyle (including a good diet and lots of physical activity) can cut that risk.

**Average week of delivery with gestational diabetes**

Having gestational diabetes means your doctor may induce labor early, at 37-38 weeks. A full-term pregnancy starts at 39 weeks. An earlier labor lowers the chances of health problems for you and your baby.

## Will I Get Type 2 Diabetes?

Because you had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of having [type 2 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes). But it's not certain that it will happen, and you can take action to prevent that.

Your blood sugar levels will likely return to normal about 6 weeks after childbirth. (Your doctor will check on that.) If it does, you should get follow-up tests at least every 3 years; your doctor may recommend yearly testing.

To lower your odds:

- Try to keep your weight in a healthy range. Not sure what that is? Ask your doctor.
- Eat lots of vegetables, whole grains, fruits, and lean [protein](https://www.webmd.com/diet/benefits-protein).
- Make exercise a habit.

If you plan to have another baby, keep in mind that you are more likely to get gestational diabetes again. Ask your doctor if any lifestyle changes would help you avoid that.

## Takeaways

Gestational diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels rise during pregnancy. It affects up to 10% of pregnancies in the U.S. It typically appears in the second half of pregnancy and often goes unnoticed, with symptoms such as more thirst, hunger, and peeing. You have a higher chance of getting it if you're overweight before pregnancy, have a family history of diabetes, and belong to certain ethnic backgrounds. Treatment focuses on tracking your blood sugar levels, adopting a healthy diet, and staying active. Although gestational diabetes usually goes away after childbirth, it can impact your baby's health and raise your chances of having type 2 diabetes later in life.

Citrulline, also commonly referred to as L-citrulline, is a non-essential amino acid. It’s considered non-essential because your body makes it on its own, specifically in the liver and intestines. It also exists in some foods, including watermelon, where it was first discovered. The name “citrulline” comes from the Latin “ _Citrullus_,” which translates to watermelon.

Unlike other amino acids, citrulline doesn’t build proteins. Instead, it plays an important role in the urea cycle, helping your body to get rid of harmful substances, particularly ammonia. It also plays an important role in widening your blood vessels (vasodilation) and may play a part in muscle building.

While the human body makes citrulline, some people increase their numbers by eating foods with the nutrient in them. Some people may also take citrulline supplements to improve athletic performance. Supplements go by a couple of different names: L-citrulline and citrulline malate. Citrulline malate is a mix of citrulline and DL-malate, a compound that may help turn food into energy.

## Health Benefits

While citrulline is necessary for the [urea cycle](https://www.webmd.com/children/urea-cycle-disorders#1), it also has a few other benefits as well. One of the biggest benefits associated with the amino acid is that it promotes vasodilation, the widening of your [blood vessels](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20030115/protecting-blood-vessels-from-stress). Current studies show that single doses of the nutrient don’t appear to have any impact. Long-term use, however, has shown to provide results for those with, or at risk for, [heart disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-symptoms#1).

Other health benefits of citrulline include:

**May Improve Athletic Performance**

Several studies show that citrulline may help to improve your athletic performance. It may do this by increasing the amount of oxygen in your muscle tissue. While supplements may not help your body use more oxygen, they could help improve the oxygen usage in your muscles, which can then help to improve your endurance.

Some studies also show that citrulline may help improve your [weight training](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/weight_training_basics#1) performance. One study found that men who took a citrulline malate supplement were able to do 53% more repetitions than those who took a [placebo](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-the-placebo-effect#1). The supplement also appears to have led to reduced muscle soreness two days later.

**Boosts** [**Heart Health**](https://www.webmd.com/heart/heart-health-tips#1)

Some research has shown that the blood vessel-widening properties of citrulline may be beneficial for your heart health. The amino acid may help to lower [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/blood-pressure-causes#1) in individuals with [hypertension](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/ss/slideshow-hypertension-overview), a risk factor for heart disease. Other research suggests that citrulline doesn’t offer any benefit to those with high blood pressure, so more studies are needed.

**Improves** [**Erectile Dysfunction**](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/guide/erectile-dysfunction-basics#1)

L-citrulline may help to boost L-arginine, which helps to boost nitric oxide production. Nitric oxide aids in blood vessel relaxation, which allows more blood to flow through your body. Some research shows that this may help individuals with erectile dysfunction. One small study showed that half of the men who took an L-citrulline supplement had an 8.3% improvement in erectile dysfunction scores over men who took a placebo.

**May Provide** [**Antidepressant**](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-treatment-options#1) **Effects**

Some studies have discovered a link between low levels of arginine and citrulline and a greater risk of depression. One study found a link between [bipolar disorder](https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/what-is-bipolar-disorder) and reduced levels of nitric oxide. The research seems to suggest that increasing citrulline and arginine may help to reduce depressive symptoms.

**May Help Those with** [**Sickle Cell Disease**](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-sickle-cell-disease#1)

Research indicates that citrulline may help to improve pain in people with sickle cell disease. Supplementation may help to improve blood health as well as overall well-being. There aren’t many studies available, however, so more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of such a treatment.

## Health Risks

In general, citrulline supplements are considered safe, even at higher doses. Even so, there are some instances in which taking it can pose a potential risk:

[**Pregnancy**](https://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/default.htm) **Concerns**

There is not enough research showing the effects of citrulline during pregnancy or while [breastfeeding](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/video/ludwig-breastfeed-impact-child-weight). As such, women who are pregnant or nursing should consult with their doctor before taking a supplement or avoid taking it.

**Medication Interactions**

Citrulline may interact with certain medications. If you take [phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/erectile-dysfunction#1-4) for erectile dysfunction, taking citrulline may cause your blood pressure to drop too low, leading to [hypotension](https://www.webmd.com/heart/understanding-low-blood-pressure-basics#1). Similar effects may occur if you take [medications for high blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/video/video-hbp-medication-overview) or nitrate medications for heart conditions. Talk to your doctor first before adding any supplement, including citrulline, to your regimen.

## Amounts and Dosage

Your body makes citrulline itself. You can increase your levels by consuming certain foods, such as:

- [Watermelon](https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-health-benefits-of-watermelon)
- Squash
- [Chickpeas](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/health-benefits-chickpeas#1)
- [Pumpkin](https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-health-benefits-pumpkin)
- [Cucumbers](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/cucumber-health-benefits#1)
- [Nuts](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-healthy-nuts)
- [Bitter Gourds](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-bitter-gourd#1)

You can also find powdered citrulline supplements, which you mix with water or blend into a smoothie. In general, the recommended dose ranges between 3 and 6 grams per day of L-citrulline or 8 grams of citrulline malate.

## What Is Gastroenteritis?

Gastroenteritis is when your stomach and intestines are irritated and inflamed. This can cause belly pain, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The cause is typically inflammation triggered by your immune system's response to a viral or bacterial infection. However, infections caused by fungi or parasites or irritation from chemicals can also lead to gastroenteritis.

You may have heard the term "stomach flu." When people say this, they usually mean gastroenteritis caused by a virus. However, it's not actually related to the flu, or influenza, which is a different virus that affects your upper respiratory system (nose, throat, and lungs).

## Gastroenteritis Symptoms

Gastroenteritis symptoms often start with little warning. You'll usually get nausea, cramps, [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/diarrhea-stomach-flu), and vomiting. Expect to make several trips to the toilet in rapid succession. Other symptoms tend to develop a little later on and include:

- Belly pain
- Loss of appetite
- Chills
- Fatigue
- Body aches
- Fever

Because of diarrhea and vomiting, you also can become dehydrated. Watch for signs of dehydration, such as dry skin, a dry mouth, feeling lightheaded, and being really thirsty. Call your doctor if you have any of these symptoms.

**How long does gastroenteritis last?**

It depends on what caused it. But generally, acute gastroenteritis lasts about 14 days. Persistent gastroenteritis lasts between 14 and 30 days, and chronic gastroenteritis lasts over 30 days.

## Stomach Flu and Children

Children and infants can get dehydrated quickly. If they do, they need to go to the doctor as soon as possible. Some [signs of dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults) in kids include:

- Sunken soft spot on your baby's head
- Sunken eyes
- Dry mouth
- No tears come out when they cry
- Not peeing or peeing very little
- Low alertness and energy (lethargy)
- Irritability

When caused by an infection — most often a virus — gastroenteritis is contagious. Young kids are more likely to have severe symptoms. Keep children with gastroenteritis out of day care or school until all their symptoms are gone.

Two vaccines are available by mouth to help protect children from infection with one of the most common causes of viral gastroenteritis: rotavirus. The two vaccines are called RotaTeq and Rotarix. Kids can get them starting at 2 months of age. Ask your doctor if your child should get a vaccine.

Check with your doctor before giving your child any medicine. Doctors don't usually recommend giving kids younger than 5 years over-the-counter drugs to control vomiting. They also don't recommend giving kids younger than 12 drugs to control diarrhea (some doctors won't recommend them for people under 18).

## Gastroenteritis Causes

The most common cause of gastroenteritis is a virus. The main types are norovirus and rotavirus. You usually get exposed to a virus through:

- Contact with someone who has an infection
- Sharing food or utensils or eating food handled by someone with an infection
- Drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated with the virus
- Touching contaminated surfaces and then putting your unwashed fingers in your mouth

**Norovirus**

[Norovirus](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/norovirus-symptoms-and-treatment) is very contagious, which means it spreads easily and quickly.

You'll usually start getting symptoms about 12-48 hours after you're exposed. You'll probably be sick for about 1-3 days, and you'll be contagious for up to 2 weeks after you start to feel better.

**Rotavirus**

Both adults and kids get rotavirus, but kids are more likely to have serious symptoms, such as severe dehydration. You can get it at any time, but it has a seasonal peak in the U.S. from January through June. Kids are most likely to get it then, and they can spread it fast to friends and family they have close contact with.

You'll usually start getting symptoms about 1-3 days after you're exposed. You'll probably be sick for about 5-7 days and contagious for a few days after you start to feel better.

**Astrovirus**

Astrovirus usually causes a fairly mild infection, with watery diarrhea. Anyone can get infected with it, but most adults will have immunity because they've had an infection at some point in their past. Infection is most common in:

- Children younger than 5
- Adults aged 65 or older
- People with a weakened immune system due to infection with HIV, having cancer, or taking immunosuppressant medicine

You'll usually start getting symptoms about 4-5 days after you're exposed, and you'll probably be sick for about 1-4 days.

**Adenovirus**

There are several strains of adenovirus. Infection with one of these usually causes a cough, runny nose, and fever. But sometimes, [adenovirus](https://www.webmd.com/children/adenovirus-infections) infection can cause stomach problems. Anyone can get it, but it's most common in kids younger than 5 years. When adults get it, it's usually because they live in more crowded areas, such as dormitories, military quarters, or nursing homes. You're also more likely to get it if you have a weakened immune system, and you may get seriously sick.

You'll usually start getting sick about 3-10 days after you're exposed, and you may be sick for as long as 2 weeks. If you have respiratory symptoms, such as a cough, they may linger for a while after you otherwise feel better.

**Bacteria**

Bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ and salmonella can also trigger the stomach flu. But this isn't as common as cases that are caused by a virus.

Salmonella and campylobacter bacteria are the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. These bacteria are usually spread by undercooked poultry, eggs, or poultry juices. Salmonella can also be spread through pet reptiles or live poultry.

Another bacteria, shigella, is often passed around in day care centers. It's typically spread from person to person, but it's also commonly spread through contaminated food and drinking water.

**Other**

Parasites can also cause gastroenteritis, but it's not common. You can pick up organisms such as giardia and cryptosporidium in contaminated swimming pools or by drinking contaminated water.

There are also other unusual ways to get gastroenteritis:

- Heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, or mercury) in drinking water
- Eating a lot of [acidic foods](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-acidic-foods), such as citrus fruit and tomatoes
- Toxins that might be found in certain seafood
- Medications such as antibiotics, antacids, laxatives, and chemotherapy drugs

## Stomach Flu Stages

Viral gastroenteritis generally has four stages:

**Exposure.** This is when you first come into contact with the virus. Symptoms usually take some time to develop, so you won't likely know you were exposed until you start getting sick.

**Incubation.** Once you've been exposed, it takes some time for the virus to infect your cells and start to reproduce. This is called the [incubation period](https://www.webmd.com/covid/coronavirus-incubation-period). It generally lasts 1-10 days, depending on which virus has infected you.

**Acute infection.** As your immune system responds to the infection, you'll develop inflammation. This is what triggers your symptoms, which can last 1-14 days, depending on the type of virus you're infected with.

**Recovery.** During this period, your symptoms start to go away and you'll feel better. However, you may still be contagious for up to 2 weeks afterward, depending on which virus caused your infection.

**Is gastroenteritis contagious?**

Gastroenteritis is not contagious, but the infections that cause it are. For example, viruses are usually spread through bodily fluids, such as spit, and poop. If someone with an infection uses the bathroom or coughs or sneezes without washing their hands afterward, they can transfer the virus to every surface they touch. One of the best ways of protecting yourself from getting infected is to wash your hands frequently throughout your day, especially before you eat or touch your face. Also, make sure you wash fresh fruits and vegetables before you eat them, and don't make food for other people if you're sick.

**How long does gastroenteritis last?**

This depends on what is causing your infection. Most cases of viral gastroenteritis will be over in a few days, but you may be sick for up to 2 weeks with some viruses, such as adenovirus.

## Gastroenteritis Risk Factors

While anybody may develop gastroenteritis, some things make you more prone to it. They include:

- Being older than 65 or younger than 6
- Living or working in a nursing home
- Working at or attending a childcare center or school
- Traveling abroad in places where infections that cause gastroenteritis are more common
- Eating raw or undercooked fish or meat
- Having a health condition that either weakens your [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/10-immune-system-busters-boosters) or requires treatment that weakens your immune system
- Drinking a lot of alcohol or taking high doses of certain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

**Stomach flu and pregnancy**

Gastroenteritis is common during pregnancy. About 30% of pregnant people will have gastroenteritis at some point in their pregnancy. Without treatment, you can get dehydrated, which can trigger early labor. If you are pregnant and you can't keep clear liquids down, talk to your doctor as soon as possible.

## Gastroenteritis Treatment

Most people won't need specific treatment for gastroenteritis. You'll likely get better on your own after a few days. The best thing you can do to speed up your recovery is to rest at home, stay hydrated, and eat bland food.

To keep yourself hydrated:

- Drink as much clear fluid as possible. If you're nauseated, try frequent small sips throughout the day or suck on ice chips.
- If you can, eat small amounts of foods that are easy to digest and have electrolytes, such as fruit juice, popsicles, broths, and saltine crackers.
- Children can get [dehydrated](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults) very quickly, so give a child with gastroenteritis a hydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to drink.

**Gastroenteritis medication**

To help ease your symptoms, your doctor may recommend medicines such as:

- Anti-nausea medications to ease your vomiting
- Anti-diarrhea medications, unless you have recently used antibiotics, have bloody diarrhea, have small amounts of blood in the stool that are too small to be seen, or have diarrhea with a fever

Antibiotics can’t treat viral gastroenteritis. They are not often used for bacterial gastroenteritis, either, as your infection should resolve on its own in a few days. However, some bacteria do require antibiotic treatment. Your doctor may do tests to help decide if you need antibiotics.

As your symptoms start to ease:

- Gradually ease back into eating your regular diet.
- Start by eating bland, easy-to-digest food such as crackers, bananas, toast, rice, and chicken.
- Avoid dairy, caffeine, and [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/addiction-heavy-drinking) until you've completely recovered.

**For infants and children**

Infants and children can get dehydrated faster than adults. Kids who are dehydrated need to go see a doctor. Keep them hydrated with a hydration solution, and avoid drinks with too much caffeine and sugar, which can make their diarrhea worse, such as:

- Carbonated sodas
- Caffeinated drinks
- Sports drinks
- Tea with sugar
- Juices

## When to Call a Doctor

Go to the doctor or ER if:

- You or your child aged over 2 years vomits for more than 1 day, has severe diarrhea (passing large amounts of loose or watery poop every 1-2 hours), or has a fever over 104 F that lasts more than 2-3 days.
- Your child under age 2 has vomiting or diarrhea for more than 12 hours or has a fever with vomiting and diarrhea.
- You or your child have any signs or symptoms of dehydration.
- Your vomit or diarrhea turns bloody or tarry (black and thick).
- You have kidney, liver, or heart disease and you can't hold anything down.
- You have sudden, severe [abdominal pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/abdominal-pain-causes-treatments).
- Your symptoms last longer than about 5 days.

Call 911 if you or your child has dehydration. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:

- Feeling very thirsty
- Not needing to pee or only needing to pee a little
- Crying without producing any tears
- Dry mouth
- Sunken eyes
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Rapid breathing and heartbeat
- Lack of alertness
- Blurred or double vision
- Trouble swallowing or breathing
- Muscle weakness

## Gastroenteritis Prevention

There’s no guaranteed way to prevent the types of infections that lead to gastroenteritis. However, you can take steps to reduce your risk of getting sick and spreading germs to others, such as:

**Wash your hands.** This is one of the most important and easiest ways to prevent getting an infection. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

**Clean surfaces thoroughly.** Clean and disinfect all shared surfaces where germs can linger.

**Handle food safely.** Wash your hands before and after you handle food. Wash fresh fruits and vegetables before you eat them. Cook, serve, and store food safely.

**Eat safe when you travel.** When you travel, you come into contact with germs that you may not otherwise. This can give you a case of traveler's diarrhea. To avoid this, drink bottled water, and only eat food that is packaged, peeled, or cooked.

**Take your medicines as prescribed by your doctor or follow package directions for over-the-counter drugs.**

**Get vaccinated.** Vaccines are available for kids to prevent [rotavirus](https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-rotavirus) infection.

## Takeaways

Gastroenteritis is inflammation from an infection in your stomach and intestines. It can cause nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting, which may cause dehydration. How long your symptoms last depends on what's causing your infection. Most people's immune systems will clear the infection in a few days.

## What Are the Signs of Labor?

Labor is another word for your body’s natural process of childbirth. It starts with your first steady contractions and goes through the delivery of both your baby and placenta.

Some have very distinct signs of labor, while others don’t. No one knows what causes labor to start or when it will start, but several hormonal and physical changes help indicate the beginning of labor.

**Lightening during labor**

The process of your baby settling or lowering into your pelvis just before labor is called lightening. It’s also referred to as the baby “dropping.”

- Lightening can happen a few weeks or a few hours before labor.
- Because the uterus exerts more pressure on the bladder after lightening, you may feel the need to urinate more often.
- However, the extra room in your upper abdomen may make it easier to breathe and relieve heartburn.

**Passing of the mucus plug**

The [mucus plug](https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-to-about-mucus-plug) accumulates at the cervix during pregnancy. When the cervix begins to open wider, the mucus is discharged into the vagina. It may be clear, pink, or slightly bloody. This is also known as “show” or “bloody show.” Labor may begin soon after the mucus plug is discharged or 1 to 2 weeks later.

**Labor contractions**

Contractions are the tightening of the muscles of the uterus. During contractions, the abdomen becomes hard. Between contractions, the uterus relaxes and the abdomen becomes soft. The way a contraction feels is different for each person, and it may feel different from one pregnancy to the next.

- [Labor contractions](https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-to-know-contractions) usually cause discomfort or a dull ache in your back and lower abdomen, along with pressure in the pelvis.
- Contractions move in a wave-like motion from the top of the uterus to the bottom.
- Some women describe contractions as strong menstrual cramps.
- Unlike false labor contractions or Braxton Hicks contractions, true labor contractions don’t stop when you change your position or relax.
- Although they may be uncomfortable, you’ll be able to relax between contractions.

**Diarrhea**

You may notice your [stools](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/what-do-different-poop-colors-mean) are loose or watery. While it may seem weird, this may be a sign that labor is 24-48 hours away.

**Back pain**

It's common to have back pain during pregnancy. It could be due to the extra strain on your back and belly muscles or just changes in posture. Heat or cold packs and massages often help.

During labor, you may have lower [back pain](https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-is-back-labor) and cramps that don't get better or go away. It can also be part of your contractions. The pain usually starts in your back and then moves around to the front of your body.

**Weight loss**

While you’re pregnant, it may seem like you’re never going to stop gaining weight. But many pregnant people actually lose a few pounds in the days leading up to labor.

**Nesting instinct**

Some find themselves with an urge to get ready shortly before their baby’s arrival. That’s known as the nesting instinct.

- You may have a sudden burst of energy after weeks of feeling more and more [tired](https://www.webmd.com/balance/how-tired-is-too-tired).
- You may feel like shopping, cooking, or cleaning the house.
- Be careful not to overdo it. Childbirth will take a lot of energy.

**Activity of the baby**

Your baby may move less as you get closer to the start of labor, but let your doctor know. It can sometimes be a sign of a problem, not an early sign of labor.

**Cramps and back pain**

It may be hard to recognize a contraction, especially with your first baby. Many pregnant people have what feels like [menstrual cramps](https://www.webmd.com/women/menstrual-cramps) in the lower abdomen. They may stay the same or may come and go. You might also have pain in your lower back that either stays or comes and goes.

**Looser joints**

If you find yourself “waddling” as your pregnancy winds down, that’s just your body getting ready for the job ahead. A hormone called relaxin loosens up the ligaments around your pelvis to make it easier for the baby to pass through.

**Water breaking**

The rupture of the [amniotic membrane](https://www.webmd.com/baby/fluid-leakage)(the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the baby during pregnancy) may happen before you get to the hospital.

- It may feel either like a sudden gush of fluid or a trickle of fluid that leaks steadily.
- The fluid is usually odorless and may look clear or straw-colored.
- If your “water breaks,” write down the time this happens, how much fluid is released, and what the fluid looks like. Share these details with your health care provider. They’ll advise you on what to do next.
- Not all pregnant people have their water break when they’re in labor. Many times, the doctor will rupture the amniotic membrane in the hospital.

**Effacement**

During labor, your cervix gets shorter and thins out in order to stretch and open around your baby's head. The shortening and thinning of the cervix is called effacement. Your [health care provider](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/health-care-21/health-care-right-doctor) will be able to tell you if there are changes to the cervix during a pelvic exam.

Effacement is measured in percentages from 0% to 100%. If there are no changes to the cervix, it is described as 0% effaced. When the cervix is half the normal thickness, it is 50% effaced. When the cervix is completely thinned out, it is 100% effaced.

**Dilation**

The stretching and opening of your cervix is called dilation and is measured in centimeters, with complete dilation being at 10 centimeters.

Effacement and dilation are a direct result of effective uterine contractions. The progress in labor is measured by how much the cervix has opened and thinned to allow your baby to pass through the vagina.

## Emotional Signs of Labor

In addition to physical signs, you may experience emotional symptoms that could be signals you're going into labor, including:

- [Mood swings](https://www.webmd.com/baby/crying-spells)
- Anxiety
- Irritability
- Impatience

## Difference Between True Labor and False Labor

Before “true” labor begins, you may have “false” labor pains, also known as [Braxton Hicks](https://www.webmd.com/baby/true-false-labor) contractions. These irregular uterine contractions are perfectly normal and may start to occur in your second trimester, although more commonly in your third trimester of pregnancy. They are your body's way of getting ready for the “real thing.”

**What do Braxton Hicks contractions feel like?**

Braxton Hicks contractions can be described as a tightening in the abdomen that comes and goes. Unlike true labor contractions, these do not get closer together, do not increase with walking, do not increase in duration, and do not feel stronger over time.

**How do I know when I am in true labor?**

To figure out if the contractions you are feeling are the real thing, ask yourself the following questions.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Contraction Characteristics** | **False Labor** | **True Labor** |
| **How often do the contractions occur?** | Contractions are often irregular and do not get closer together. | Contractions come at regular intervals and last about 30-70 seconds. As time progresses, they get closer together. |
| **Do they change with movement?** | Contractions may stop when you walk or rest. They may even stop if you change positions. | Contractions continue despite movement or changing positions. |
| **How strong are they?** | Contractions are usually weak and do not get much stronger. Or they may be strong at first and then get weaker. | Contractions steadily increase in strength. |
| **Where do you feel the pain?** | Contractions are usually only felt in the front of the abdomen or pelvic region. | Contractions usually start in the lower back and move to the front of the abdomen. |

## Timing Contractions

When you think you are in true labor, start timing your contractions. To do this, write down the time each contraction starts and stops or have someone do it for you. The time between contractions includes the length or duration of the contraction and the minutes in between the contractions (called the interval). Some people use a contractions timer app to keep track of their contractions.

Mild contractions generally begin 15-20 minutes apart and last 60-90 seconds. The contractions become more regular until they are less than 5 minutes apart. [Active labor](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-stages-labor) (the time you should come into the hospital) is usually characterized by strong contractions that last 45-60 seconds and occur 3-4 minutes apart.

## Try to Relax

**How to ease labor pain**

It’s best to go through the first stage of labor (called the latent phase) in the comfort of your home. Here are some tips that might help:

- **Distract yourself.** Take a walk, or watch a movie.
- **Soak in a warm tub or take a**[**warm shower**](https://www.webmd.com/baby/does-a-hot-bath-induce-labor). But, ask your health care provider if you can take a tub bath if your water has broken.
- **Rest**. Try to sleep or take a nap if it is in the evening. You need to store up your energy for active labor.
- **Apply heat**. Use a heat pack on your lower back or abdomen to ease symptoms.
- **Try massage**. Ask a friend or partner to massage your back or feet.
- **Try aromatherapy**. While there's no proven evidence that it aids pain relief, some people find the scents from warming [essential oils](https://www.webmd.com/baby/is-it-safe-to-use-essential-oils-while-pregnant) soothing.

## When to Go to the Hospital for Labor

When you suspect you are in true labor, call your health care provider. Also, call:

- If you think your water has broken
- If you’re bleeding (more than spotting)
- If the baby seems to be moving less than normal
- When your contractions are very uncomfortable and have been coming every 5 minutes for an hour
- If you have any of the signs of labor but you haven’t reached your [37th week of pregnancy](https://www.webmd.com/baby/your-pregnancy-week-by-week-weeks-35-40). You may be going into labor before your baby is ready and will need medical help right away.

Your health care provider will give you specific guidelines about when you should get ready to come to the hospital.

## Takeaways

You may experience a wide range of physical and emotional symptoms during the early stages of labor. Early on, make yourself as comfortable as you can at home and continue timing your contractions. Once you begin having contractions lasting 45-60 seconds every 3-4 minutes, it's time to head to the hospital.

## Signs of Labor FAQs

- **How long is labor?**

On average, labor for your first pregnancy lasts 12-24 hours. For pregnancies after that, labor is often shorter and may last 8-10 hours.

- **Do frequent Braxton Hicks contractions mean labor is approaching soon?**

No. Braxton Hicks contractions are infrequent, uterine contractions that may begin during your second or [third trimester](https://www.webmd.com/baby/third-trimester-of-pregnancy). Although uncomfortable, these contractions will likely stop if you change positions. Unlike labor contractions, you should be able to talk and walk through them.

You'll feel Braxton Hicks contractions in the front of your abdomen, not in your lower back, where you'll feel true labor contractions.

- **Can you go into labor without losing your mucus plug?**

Yes. Some people may go into labor without ever losing their mucus plug. Others may experience different symptoms of labor first before losing their mucus plug.

## Drug Interactions: What You Need to Know

By [Evan Starkman](https://www.webmd.com/evan-starkman)

Medically Reviewed by [Joshua Conrad, PharmD](https://www.webmd.com/joshua-conrad)

### What Are Drug Interactions?

When a [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) works right, it boosts your health or helps you feel better. But a drug can bring on problems if it doesn't mix well with something else you put into your body, like another medication, a certain food, or [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/rm-quiz-alcohol-myths-facts).

When that happens, it's called a [drug interaction](https://www.webmd.com/interaction-checker/default.htm). It could make your medication stop working, become less effective, or too strong. It could also trigger side effects.

The more you learn about drug interactions, the better you'll be able to avoid them. Here's what you need to know.

### What Are the 3 Types of Drug Interactions?

The main types are:

**Drug-drug interaction**. This is when a medication reacts with one or more other drugs. For example, taking a [cough medicine](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cough-syrup-cough-medicine) ( [antitussive](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-54333-antitussive+oral.aspx)) and a drug to help you [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm) (sedative) could cause the two medications to affect each other.

**Drug-food/drink interaction**. This is when something you eat or drink affects a drug. For instance, it can be dangerous to drink alcohol while you're on certain medications. Some [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/default.htm) and [dietary supplements](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-faq) interact with medicines, too.

**Drug-condition interaction**. This is when you have a health problem that makes it risky for you to take certain meds. For example, if you have a condition like [high blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm), taking a [decongestant](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants) for a [cold](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/default.htm) could drive up your [blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers) even more.

### What Drugs Can You Not Take Together?

There are many types of drugs you shouldn't take together, but in general, don't take combinations like these:

**Two or more drugs that share an active ingredient.** You could have side effects or an [overdose](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/drug-overdose). Active ingredients are the chemicals in medications that treat your condition or symptoms. Always check for them on the drug label.

**Blood-thinning drugs with [NSAIDs](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/features/pain-relief-how-nsaids-work)**. Your odds for a dangerous bleed could go up. NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are pain relievers like [ibuprofen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-9368-IBUPROFEN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5166&drugname=ibuprofen+oral) or [naproxen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-1289-NAPROXEN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5173&drugname=Naproxen+Oral). If you're on a blood thinner, ask your doctor to suggest a different type of over-the-counter pain medication and dose that's safer for you.

**Pills with antihistamines.** Taking these together can cause you to react more slowly, which would make it dangerous for you to drive or work with heavy machines.

Some other drug-drug combinations that can be dangerous are:

- An NSAID pain reliever with a blood pressure drug
- A thyroid drug called [levothyroxine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1433/levothyroxine+oral/details) with an acid-blocking proton pump inhibitor drug called [omeprazole](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3766/omeprazole+oral/details)
- An [SSRI](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-medications-antidepressants) antidepressant with another medicine that affects serotonin (such as [dextromethorphan](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-77506-dmax+oral.aspx), [linezolid](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-6154-LINEZOLID+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=18168&drugname=linezolid+oral), tramadol, and [trazodone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11188/trazodone+oral/details))
- A cholesterol-lowering [statin](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/video/should-i-take-a-statin) with antifungal and fibrate meds that are commonly called "azole" drugs (Their technical names are "imidazole and triazole derivatives." They lower blood fats called [triglycerides](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/lowering-triglyceride-levels).)
- The antibiotic clarithromycin with a type of blood pressure drug called a calcium channel blocker

### What Are Common Drug Interactions?

Certain foods and drinks don't mix well with some medications. A few of these are:

**Alcohol**. Booze can bring on dangerous side effects with many medications, including some drugs for:

- [Allergies](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/default.htm)
- Cold and flu
- [High cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/default.htm)
- High blood pressure
- [Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/default.htm) (ADHD)
- [Depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/default.htm)
- [Diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm)
- Infections
- [Pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm)
- Poor sleep

Before you start a new medication, ask your doctor or [pharmacist](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/pharmacists-they-do-more-than-fill-prescriptions) if it could interact with alcohol. Check the drug label for alcohol warnings, too.

**Grapefruit or grapefruit juice.** Too much of either can affect some drugs like:

- [Statins](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/side-effects-of-statin-drugs)
- [Antihistamines](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/antihistamines-for-allergies)
- [Blood pressure drugs](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/how-take-blood-pressure-medicine-properly-why-you-should)
- [Anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/default.htm) meds
- Transplant anti-rejection drugs

Grapefruit juice doesn't mix badly with every type of drug in these classes of medications. Check your drug's label or information pamphlet for any warnings about it. Also, ask your doctor or pharmacist if it's safe to have grapefruit or its juice in any amount with your specific drug. If they tell you to stop eating or drinking it, ask if any other fruits or juices might have similar effects on your medicine.

**[Foods with vitamin K](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-guide-vitamin-k)**, like leafy [greens](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-greens). These can interact with the [blood thinner](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ss/slideshow-tips-for-taking-blood-thinners) warfarin. You don't have to stop eating them, but it's important to be consistent and not overdo it. Ask your doctor how much food with vitamin K you can have, then eat the same amount around the same times each week.

**High- [potassium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-potassium) foods and drinks**, like bananas, salt substitutes, and orange juice. These can affect blood pressure drugs called [ACE inhibitors](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/medicine-ace-inhibitors). Your doctor will track your potassium levels, and they may tell you to cut back on foods with it.

**St. John's wort**. This herbal dietary supplement can affect many medications for heart disease, [HIV](https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/default.htm), [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/understanding-depression-basics), and other conditions. It can also affect [birth control pills](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills) and the [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm) drugs [irinotecan](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-13700-irinotecan+iv.aspx) and [imatinib](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-20983-imatinib+oral.aspx).

Always get your doctor's or pharmacist's OK before you try a new supplement. It's also possible for a medication you take to interact with a health condition you have. Some common drug-condition interactions happen between:

- Antacids and [kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information)
- Antihistamines and certain [breathing problems](https://www.webmd.com/lung/breathing-problems-causes-tests-treatments), [glaucoma](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/glaucoma-eyes), [and enlarged prostate](https://webmd.com/men/prostate-enlargement-bph/default.htm)
- Asthma rescue inhalers and conditions like [heart disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/default.htm), high blood pressure, [thyroid](https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/understanding-thyroid-problems-basics) disease, and diabetes
- Decongestants and conditions like heart disease, [high blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus-high-blood-pressure), thyroid disease, and diabetes
- [Sleep aids](https://www.webmd.com/women/natural-sleep-remedies) and certain [breathing problems](https://www.webmd.com/lung/breathing-problems), glaucoma, and enlarged prostate

### Is It OK to Take All Your Medications at Once?

It's important to take your medication as directed by your doctor or pharmacist. If two meds interact, spacing them apart during the day may not stop them from interacting and could lead to new or worse problems. To avoid an interaction, your doctor may need to change your dose or prescribe a different medication.

### What Are the Symptoms of a Drug Interaction?

The symptoms of a drug interaction can vary a lot, depending on the drugs you’re taking and how they’re interacting. Sometimes you might not even know right away that an interaction is happening.

If you do notice an interaction, it will usually feel like one of these is happening:

- You are having more side effects from a drug
- Your drug doesn’t seem to be working as well as it was before

In general, call your doctor if you're having side effects that worry you or if your medicine doesn't seem to be working, especially after you’ve recently started or changed doses of a drug.

### How Do Drug Interactions Happen?

There are several ways that drugs can interact with one another. Here are some examples of the most common ways.

When two drugs can cause the same side effect and are used at the same time, they might cause more of that side effect. For example, if two drugs can each make you sleepy, taking them together can make you more or dangerously sleepy.

When the unwanted effects of one drug are the opposite of the desired effects of another drug, you might end up with less of the desired effects. For example, taking one medication that raises blood pressure as an unwanted effect may decrease the benefits of taking another medication to lower your blood pressure.

Most drugs that you swallow enter your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) through your [intestines](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-intestines). Sometimes a drug or supplement can block or trap another drug in the intestine before it can be absorbed. For example, supplements like [calcium](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1575/calcium+oral/details) and iron can prevent absorption of [thyroid](https://www.webmd.com/women/picture-of-the-thyroid) meds.

Your body has enzymes, such as the cytochrome p450 (CYP) and others, that process many types of medications. This is called [metabolism](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/rm-quiz-truth-about-metabolism). It also has a way to get rid of drugs, usually though your [urine](https://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/truth-about-urine). Other drugs may speed up, slow down, or even completely block these functions. When this happens, the amount of drug in your body may increase (similar to taking too much) or decrease (similar to taking too little). Either way, this could cause serious problems.

### How Do You Look for Drug Interactions?

**Work closely with your doctor.** Make sure they know all the medicines, vitamins, and supplements you're taking. That's extra important if you have more than one doctor who prescribes medicines for you. You could show them a list of the meds you're taking, or bring the medication packages to your appointment.

Before you take a new drug, ask your doctor or pharmacist questions like:

- Can I take this with my other meds?
- Should I avoid certain foods, drinks, or other products?
- Could this medication interact with any health conditions I have?

Pharmacists are experts on medicine safety, and they can work with your doctors to help you avoid drug interactions. For example, if you have two doctors and they separately prescribe drugs that interact, your pharmacist can warn them -- and you -- before you have a problem.

**Read labels carefully.** Over-the-counter drug labels include information about possible drug interactions and the medication's active ingredients. Prescription medications usually come with a sheet that explains what the drug is and how to take it safely.

But most drug labels and patient handouts don't list every possible drug interaction. Talk to your pharmacist to get the full picture. They can also answer any questions about medical terms or jargon on the drug packages.

So you're never going to have a thick, lush head of [hair](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics) again. But at least you'd like to hang on to what you've got. Short of a transplant, is there anything you can do to stop thinning [hair](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cm/rm-quiz-hair-care)?

Yes. With some treatments, you can slow down or stop hair thinning -- and maybe even grow back some hair you thought was gone forever. Read on to see what works and what doesn't.

## Minoxidil

This is the only over-the-counter [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) for hair loss approved by the FDA for use by both men and women. It won't rescue a receding hairline. It does stimulate hair growth, although scientists aren't quite sure how it works.

[Minoxidil](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8680/minoxidil+oral/details) is available as [Rogaine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-12570/rogaine+topical/details) or [Theroxidi](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-61193/theroxide-10-topical/details) l, or in generic form. It's sold as a liquid or foam and in two strengths: 2% and 5%. There's also oral Minoxidil 2.5 -5 mg daily dose to grow hair.

- **Effectiveness:** Minoxidil works for about 2 out of 3 men. It's most effective if you're under age 40 and have only recently started to lose your hair.
- **How to use it:** Twice a day, when your hair is dry, apply minoxidil on your scalp where the hair has started to thin. Then be patient. You may not notice changes for 4 months or more.
- **What it doesn't do:** Minoxidil does not cure baldness. If you stop using it, you will start losing hair again. Your hair may fall out faster than before.
- **Side effects:** You may have redness, [itching](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-pruritus), dryness, flaking, or other scalp irritation, though this is uncommon. It's more likely if you use the stronger 5% solution.

## Finasteride

This medication stops your body from making the hormone at the root of [male pattern baldness](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics), DHT (dihydrotestosterone). It is available under the brand name Propecia. Learn more about [spotting the early signs of having high DHT](https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/symptoms-of-high-dht).

- **Effectiveness:** [Finasteride](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-167-FINASTERIDE+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=1548&drugname=finasteride+oral) is very effective. It slows or stops [hair loss](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/cm/rm-quiz-hair-loss) in nearly 90% of men. About two-thirds of these men also regrow some hair.
- **How to use it:** Finasteride is a pill. Usually, you take it once a day. Your dermatologist may recommend using it in combination with minoxidil.
- **What it doesn't do:** Like minoxidil, it doesn't cure hair loss. If you stop taking it, you will lose hair again.
- **Side effects:** Finasteride can [cause erectile dysfunction](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/why-cant-i-get-an-erection) and other sexual side effects, though this is unusual. If it happens to you, it will likely clear up once you stop taking finasteride. But for some men, that can take 3 months or more.

## Biotin and Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)

[Biotin](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-guide-biotin) is a B vitamin that is essential for your health. You most likely get plenty of it in your diet in egg yolks, yeast, [liver](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-liver-failure), and other foods. That’s good news because too little biotin can cause hair loss. Does that mean that taking mega-doses of it will give you more hair? Probably not. No scientific studies have shown biotin to prevent or treat hair loss. Learn more about [biotin and hair loss](https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/does-biotin-really-prevent-hair-loss).

Hair supplements like Viviscal or Nutrafol have shown success in stimulating hair growth.

You may have heard that laser combs, brushes, hoods, and caps can help halt hair loss. The theory is that when hair follicles absorb laser light at a certain level, it stimulates hair to grow. But there’s not enough evidence that any of these devices restore hair or prevent balding.

## When to See a Doctor for Hair Loss

If you lose hair suddenly, see your doctor. It may be caused by illnesses, medicine, or low levels of iron or vitamin D.

## What Is Nasal Congestion and Sinus Pressure?

It's one of life's miseries: Your nose is stuffed and your face aches. You might feel pressure around your nose, eyes, forehead, and maybe even your scalp.

This kind of nasal congestion and sinus pressure have many causes: colds, the flu, sinus infections, and allergies, to name a few. Whatever your triggers are, the symptoms can get to you.

![illustration of inflamed sinuses](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/reference_guide/how_to_treat_nasal_congestion_and_sinus_pressure_ref_guide/750x500_how_to_treat_nasal_congestion_and_sinus_pressure_ref_guide.jpg)

What’s actually causing that stuffed-up feeling? When you have a respiratory infection or allergies, the membranes lining your nasal passages get inflamed, swollen, and irritated. They make more mucus to flush out whatever causes the irritation, such as an allergen. If you have a condition called nonallergic rhinitis, smoke and other kinds of air pollution or even strong odors might irritate.

Whatever the cause, the mucus and swelling can cause pressure and pain.

Nasal congestion and sinus pressure caused by colds and other passing infections usually clear up within a few days. Symptoms caused by allergies or other airborne irritants can come and go. While you're waiting for relief, you may be able to tame symptoms with some nonprescription remedies.

**Decongestants**

These medicines help reduce the swelling in your nasal passages and ease the stuffiness and sinus pressure.

They come as nasal sprays, such as naphazoline (Privine), oxymetazoline (Afrin, Dristan, Nostrilla, Vicks Sinus Nasal Spray), or [phenylephrine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-21821/phenylephrine-oral/details) (Neo-Synephrine, Rhinall, Sinex).

They also come as pills, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), and in liquid cold and flu formulas. One drug — phenylephrine (Sudafed PE and others) — has long been sold as a decongestant, but isn't effective in pill and liquid forms, according to the FDA.

Follow the directions for using these drugs. Don’t use decongestant pills or liquid medicines for more than a week without checking with your doctor. And don't use a [decongestant nasal spray](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants) for more than three days, because it could make your congestion worse.

Also, decongestants can raise your blood pressure, so check with your doctor first if you have any health issues or take other medicines. Never give decongestants or any over-the-counter cold medicine to children under age 4.

**Antihistamines**

If allergies are behind your nasal congestion and sinus pressure, allergy medicines containing antihistamines [may help ease symptoms by controlling part of the allergic reaction. They](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/antihistamines-for-allergies) relieve sniffling and sneezing. You might use them along with a decongestant.

Antihistamines can also help with nonallergic rhinitis.

Some nonprescription antihistamines can make you sleepy, but some don't. You might make different choices during the day and at night. Nighttime cold medicines often contain a sedating antihistamine.

Read and follow the label, and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.

**Steroid nasal sprays**

These can help lower inflammation and nasal stuffiness caused by allergies or nonallergic rhinitis. They can take a couple of days to kick in, so it's ideal to start them before you have symptoms — like a little before your worst allergy season. If you use them for allergies, keep using them throughout the season.

**Menthol**

Medicated ointments that have menthol or [camphor](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/camphor-uses-amd-risks) in them can't ease congestion. But when you rub some on your chest or throat and breathe it in, the strong odor might trick your [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-diseases) into thinking you are breathing better. They aren't safe to put on your face.

**Pain relievers**

Although they won’t clear up congestion, pain relievers such as [acetaminophen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-362/acetaminophen-oral/details), [ibuprofen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5166-9368/ibuprofen-oral/ibuprofen-oral/details), and naproxen can ease the pain caused by sinus pressure. Follow the dosing instructions on the label.

**How to treat sinus congestion during [pregnancy](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-am-i-pregnant)**

If you have nasal or sinus congestion while you're pregnant, talk to your doctor about what's safe for you. While they might suggest some nonprescription remedies, those recommendations can differ depending on your health and stage of pregnancy.

For example, pseudoephedrine — the main ingredient in Sudafed — isn't recommended during the first three months of pregnancy due to a potential link to serious birth defects. Ask your doctor about safe nondrug remedies, such as nasal rinses.

## Prescription Medicines for Sinus Congestion

Whether your doctor recommends any prescription medicines for your nasal congestion and sinus pressure will depend on the cause, how long you've been sick, and how severe your symptoms are.

There's no prescription remedy for the common cold, which is caused by viruses. However, if your doctor thinks your cold-like symptoms are caused by bacteria, you might get an antibiotic.

Most sinus infections are also caused by viruses and aren't helped by antibiotics, which treat bacteria. Most cases will go away within two weeks without antibiotics. But if your symptoms last more than a week, get worse after getting better, or come with thick mucus that's green or yellow, your doctor will be more likely to prescribe an antibiotic.

If you have chronic sinus infections, you might need additional medications or even surgery to deal with underlying causes.

If you have the flu or COVID-19, you might get an antiviral drug to speed up your recovery and reduce symptoms.

If you have allergies, your doctor might recommend prescription versions of some steroid nose sprays and antihistamines.

## Natural Remedies for Nasal Congestion and Sinus Pressure

When you’re stuffed up, one of the best things you can do is keep your nasal passages and sinuses moist. People sometimes think that dry air might help clear up a runny nose, but it actually has the opposite effect. Drying out the membranes will irritate them further.

To keep your nasal passages moist, you can:

**Drink lots of fluids.** This will thin out your mucus, which could help prevent blocked sinuses.

**Use a nasal saline spray.** It’s salt water, and it will help keep your nasal passages from drying out. Unlike decongestant nasal sprays, you can use these every day for a long time.

**Try a**[**neti pot**](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/neti-pots)**,****nasal irrigator, or bulb syringe.** Use distilled, sterile water or water that’s been boiled and cooled to make the solution you pour or squirt into your nose. Rinse the device after each use and let it air dry.

**Try some steam.** Take long showers.Or breathe in steam from a pot of warm (but not too hot) water.

Other ways to ease sinus congestion:

**Blow your nose the right way.** Blow gently into a disposable tissue to avoid spreading germs and pushing mucus into your ears or other parts of your sinuses. Block one nostril while you blow through the other. Wash your hands afterward.

**Use a bioelectronic sinus device.** The device is placed on the face and uses very small electrical currents to stimulate nerves, helping reduce pain and congestion.

**Place a warm, wet towel on your face.** It may relieve discomfort and open your [nasal passages](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/remedies-stuffy-nose).

**Avoid chlorinated pools.** They can irritate your nasal passages.

**How to treat nasal congestion at night**

Nasal congestion can be especially annoying at night, when it can interfere with your sleep. So, you might want to take that hot shower just before bed. Other ideas:

**Use a humidifier or vaporizer.** A humidifier uses cool water to release a fine mist into the air. If you use one, use only filtered or distilled water and follow directions for keeping the machine clean. A vaporizer boils water and releases steam. If there's a child in your home, avoid vaporizers, as they pose a burning risk.

**Try sticky nasal strips.** They help widen your nostrils, which may help you breathe and sleep better.

**Prop yourself up.** At bedtime, lie on a couple of pillows. Keeping your head elevated may make breathing more comfortable.

## Congested Sinus Relief in Children

Remember that you should never give decongestants or any other over-the-counter cold medicines to children younger than age 4. If your child is between 4 and 6, you should check with your doctor before using these medicines.

Many of the home remedies that ease symptoms in adults will also help a child with nasal congestion and sinus pressure. Be sure to give them plenty of fluids. You can also try:

- Humidifiers
- Saline nose drops
- Raising their head on pillows at night (unless they are babies, who shouldn't use pillows)
- Sitting with them in a steamy bathroom, with a hot shower running

Older children may be able to take some over-the-counter remedies. But talk to their doctor about the best choices.

When an infant has congestion, you can try suctioning out mucus with a bulb syringe. Don't be tempted to let them sleep in a car seat or swing to stay upright. Their crib is the safest place.

## How to Relieve Sinus Pressure in Ears

Your sinuses and ears are connected inside your head. So, sinus congestion and stuffiness can affect the pressure in your ears. That can cause ear pain, muffle your hearing, and even make you dizzy. Treating sinus congestion may help. Other tips include:

**No fast movements.** Don’t stand up too quickly or shake your head fast.

**Avoid caffeine, salt, [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms-treatments), and tobacco products.** These can affect your circulation, and minor changes in blood flow can affect your ears.

**Avoid extreme temperatures.** They can make sinus-related [ear problems](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ear-infection/why-does-ear-hurt) worse. If your ears bother you, it isn’t the time to go jogging on a hot day or build a snow fort with the kids.

**Try swallowing, yawning, or chewing sugar-free gum.** The same moves that help you open your ears on an airplane might provide temporary relief when your ears are plugged for other reasons.

## How Can You Get Rid of Sinus Pressure Headaches?

If a sinus headache is caused by infection, the best treatment is getting rid of the infection, either on its own over time or with medication. In the meantime, home treatments that might help include:

- Warm compresses
- Decongestants
- Saline nasal sprays

One thing to keep in mind — many headaches that seem like sinus headaches may actually be migraine attacks or tension headaches. They aren't caused by infections. So, they might respond best to pain medicines or other more targeted medicines prescribed by a doctor.

Your headache is more likely to be a migraine if it's triggered by noise or bright lights, or if you have nausea and vomiting.

It's more likely to be caused by a [sinus infection](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinusitis-and-sinus-infection) if it happens with:

- A cold or shortly afterward
- Thick, discolored mucus
- A decreased sense of smell
- Pain in one cheek or your upper teeth

## When to See Your Doctor

Consult your doctor if you have:

- Nasal congestion and sinus pressure for more than 10 days
- A high fever, which is 103 F in adults and lower in children and babies (check with your pediatrician for guidance)
- A [sore throat](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/understanding-sore-throat-basics)
- Discolored mucus
- Severe headaches or other pain that doesn't get better with painkillers

## Takeaways

Nasal congestion and sinus pressure can make you feel lousy. But some good self-care, along with over-the-counter medicines if needed, can go a long way toward making you feel better. When your symptoms are caused by colds or other passing infections, they usually go away in a few days. When they're caused by allergies or nonallergic sensitivities to common irritants, you may need a longer-term strategy to keep breathing clearly.

## Sinus Congestion and Sinus Pressure FAQs

**Can sinus congestion cause tooth pain?**

Yes, sinus congestion can cause pressure that spreads to your jaws and teeth. You are most likely to feel it in your upper back teeth because your largest sinuses sit right over them. But always get a persistent toothache checked by a dentist.

**Can sinus congestion make you dizzy?**

Yes, you can get dizzy when you have sinus congestion. The cause is likely inflammation, swelling, and fluid in your Eustachian tubes, the passages that connect your ears to your sinuses. That fluid and pressure can affect the inner ear structures that maintain your sense of balance.

## What Is an Incubation Period?

The incubation [period](https://www.webmd.com/women/5-things-about-your-period) is the number of days it takes for symptoms to appear after you’re infected with something. Health care professionals and government officials use this number to decide how long people need to stay away from others during an outbreak. It’s different for every condition.

If you’ve been around someone who has the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, you’re at risk, too. That means you need to stay home until you know you’re in the clear. Health professionals call this self-quarantine. But when will you know you're sick? The answer depends on the COVID-19 incubation period.

## What Is the Incubation Period for COVID-19?

Viruses are constantly changing, which sometimes leads to new strains called “variants.” Different [COVID-19 variants](https://www.webmd.com/covid/coronavirus-strains) can have different incubation periods.

When researchers set out to learn the incubation period for the original strain of COVID-19, they studied dozens of confirmed cases reported between Jan. 4 and Feb. 24, 2020. These cases included only people who knew that they’d been around someone who was sick.

On average, symptoms showed up in the newly infected person about 5.6 days after contact. Rarely, symptoms appeared as soon as 2 days after exposure. Most people with symptoms had them by day 12. And most of the other ill people were sick by day 14. In rare cases, symptoms can show up after 14 days. Researchers think this happens with about 1 out of every 100 people.

Some people may have COVID-19 and never show symptoms. Others may not know that they have it because their symptoms are very mild. Current studies might not include the mildest cases, and the COVID-19 incubation period could be different for these.

**How long after exposure will you test positive for COVID-19?**

Depending on which COVID-19 variant you've been exposed to, you may test positive 3-5 days later. If you've been exposed to the virus but don't have any symptoms, wait for 5 days before you get tested. If you test too early and you do have COVID-19, you may falsely test negative.

## Omicron Incubation Period

The [Omicron variant](https://www.webmd.com/covid/covid-omicron-variant), which evolved from previous strains of COVID-19, was once the most dominant type of coronavirus in the U.S. Research shows it spreads faster and has a shorter incubation period than the SARS-CoV-2 variants that came before it.

Omicron’s incubation is around 3 days, compared with 4-5 days for earlier strains. This means that if you get infected with the Delta strain, your symptoms may show up much faster. Your body will also shed the virus (meaning you're contagious) earlier.

The mutation allows the virus to produce a higher load of viral particles in the body. This makes the Omicron variant more than two times as contagious as earlier variants.

Vaccines and [booster](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/vaccine-booster-shots) shots help protect people from serious illness, hospitalization, and death. If you’re fully vaccinated and you get a breakthrough infection of Omicron, you’re less likely to become seriously ill than an [unvaccinated](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/covid-19-family-unvaccinated) person.

## When Is COVID-19 the Most Contagious?

Researchers estimate that people who get infected with COVID-19 can spread it to others 2-3 days before symptoms start and are most contagious 1-2 days before they feel sick.

if you have the Omicron variant, you may become contagious more quickly because of its shorter COVID-19 incubation period. But we need more research on this.

## How Long Are You Contagious With COVID-19?

According to the CDC, if you have mild to moderate COVID-19, you may be contagious for 10 days from the first day you notice symptoms.

If you were severely affected or critically ill from COVID-19, you may stay infectious for up to 20 days from the start of your symptoms.

Your infectiousness is highest 1 day before the start of your symptoms and begins to wane about a week later for most people.

The Omicron variant has a shorter COVID-19 incubation period compared with other variants. For the Omicron variant, the incubation period is 1-4 days.

## Can I Get or Spread COVID-19 During or After the Vaccination Process?

When you get a [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/covid-19-vaccine), it teaches your [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function) to recognize the virus as a foreign element and fight it. Studies show that COVID-19 vaccines can greatly reduce your chances of getting infected with the virus. But if you do catch it after you’re vaccinated, the vaccine will still help protect you from getting as seriously ill or needing hospitalization.

It’s important to note that you’re not optimally protected until 2 weeks after you get your second dose of a two-shot vaccine. That’s because it takes around 2 weeks for your body to build protection against the virus. And because the incubation period is shorter than the wait time between doses, it’s possible to catch COVID-19 before or just after your vaccination, as your body has not had enough time to build immunity. If this happens, the CDC recommends waiting until you’ve fully recovered to get the vaccine.

## COVID-19 Quarantine Guidelines

The CDC says that if you might have come into contact with the virus and have no symptoms, you should self-monitor. This means watching for signs such as fever, [cough](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/overview), and [shortness of breath](https://www.webmd.com/lung/shortness-breath-dyspnea). Stay out of crowded places, keep at least 6 [feet](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/foot-pain-causes-and-treatments) away from other people, and wear a high-quality [face mask](https://www.webmd.com/covid/coronavirus-face-masks) when you have to go out.

If you know that you came into contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should self-quarantine if you are:

- Fully vaccinated with possible COVID-19 symptoms
- Unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated

If you’re unvaccinated or are more than [6 months](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nutrition) away from your full vaccination and haven’t yet had your booster shot, the CDC recommends you:

- Isolate for 5 days.
- Follow strict mask use for 5 more days.

But if the 5-day quarantine isn’t possible for you, the CDC suggests you wear a well-fitted mask around other people for 10 days after exposure.

If you’ve gotten your vaccination and booster shot, you don’t need to quarantine after coming into contact with a positive COVID-19 case. But you should wear a mask for 10 days after exposure.

If you’ve been exposed in any case, the best option would also include a [COVID-19 test](https://www.webmd.com/covid/coronavirus-testing) on the fifth day after exposure. If you start to have symptoms, you should quarantine until you get a negative test that shows your symptoms weren’t caused by COVID-19.

Still, after you leave quarantine, you should continue to monitor yourself for any symptoms.

## What if I Get Sick or Test Positive While in Quarantine?

Take extra safety measures if you think or know you have COVID-19, or if you test positive for the virus but don't have symptoms. Isolate yourself from other people in your home. Choose a “sick room” or a separate area to stay in, and use a different bathroom if possible.

The CDC has shortened its recommended isolation time for people with COVID-19 who don't have symptoms to 5 days. After this period, they suggest you wear a mask around others for 5 more days.

## Takeaways

If you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may begin to show symptoms after a 3-5 day incubation period. The amount of time will depend on the variant you were exposed to. Staying up to date on [COVID-19 booster vaccinations](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/covid-19-vaccine-booster) will lower your chances of becoming seriously ill with the virus.

## COVID-19 Incubation Period FAQs

- **How long does it take for symptoms of COVID-19 to appear after exposure?**

COVID-19 symptoms may show 2-14 days after you've been exposed to the virus. This timeline depends on which variant you were exposed to.

- **What is the most common incubation period for COVID-19?**

The incubation period varies for different strains of COVID-19. On average, the incubation period for COVID-19 across all variants is about 6 days.

The persimmon is a fruit that comes from certain trees in the genus _Diospyros_. Like the tomato, it is technically a berry but rarely considered one.

The fruit is picked in late fall and sometimes stays on the tree into winter. Depending on the strain, the color ranges from yellow to dark red-orange. While some persimmons are spherical, others have the shape of an acorn or pumpkin. In size, they can be anywhere from the size of a half-dollar to a small grapefruit.

When choosing a persimmon to eat, it is important to know whether it is astringent or non-astringent. Asian persimmon varieties, which are also commercially grown in California and Florida, may be either. The most popular of these is the Fuyu persimmon. American persimmon varieties are only astringent. The most popular is the Hachiya persimmon.

Non-astringent persimmons may be eaten while hard or after they soften. Astringent persimmons should only be eaten after they have fully ripened, turning soft and deep in color.

Persimmons are loaded with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. In season, you can find them in many markets, and they are delicious on their own or in cooked dishes and baked goods.

## Health Benefits

Persimmons are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which each provide important health benefits. For example, [vitamin C](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1001/vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid) helps support the immune system and protect against heart disease.

Persimmons are also high in [soluble dietary fiber](https://www.webmd.com/diet/compare-dietary-fibers#:~:text=The%20average%20person%20only%20gets,of%20different%20types%20of%20fiber.), which slows the digestion of carbohydrates, preventing spikes in blood sugar.

Persimmons provide several other health benefits, including:

**Heart Health**

Persimmons can help keep your arteries clear and reduce the risk of [heart disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/default.htm). [Atherosclerosis](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/what-is-atherosclerosis#1) refers to the hardening and narrowing of arteries, and one study found persimmons rich in dietary fiber, antioxidants, and minerals that are part of an antiatherosclerotic diet.

One component of persimmons, its tannin-rich fiber, has proven particularly effective in treating [high cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/default.htm).

**Eye Health**

Persimmons can help keep your eyes healthy. One serving contains more than half the recommended daily intake of [vitamin A](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/supplement-guide-vitamin-a#1), which is important to vision. In addition, persimmon peel is rich in [lutein](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-754/lutein), which is known to help protect against eye disease.

[**Diabetes**](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm) **Prevention and Reduced Risk of Complications**

The peel of a persimmon contains flavanoids that have proven to have antidiabetic and antioxidant properties. They protect against the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), harmful compounds that form when protein or fat combines with sugar in the blood. AGEs have been linked to both the onset of diabetes and to long-term health complications resulting from the disease.

## Nutrition

Persimmons are a good source of vitamins A and C as well as [manganese](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-182/manganese), which helps the blood to clot. They also have other [antioxidants](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/antioxidants-in-fruits#1), which help reduce the risk of many serious health conditions including [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm) and [stroke](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/stroke-types).

**Nutrients per Serving**

One serving of persimmons contains approximately:

- Calories: 118
- [Protein](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/good-protein-sources): 1 gram
- [Fat](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/good-fat-bad-fat): 0 grams
- [Carbohydrates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-carbohydrates-overview): 31 grams
- [Fiber](https://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/fiber-how-much-do-you-need): 6 grams
- Sugars: 21 grams

**Portion Sizes**

A typical portion is one average-sized persimmon. While persimmons are healthy, like all fruit, they are high in sugar. Pay attention to your intake as part of a balanced diet.

## How to Eat Persimmons

Here are some ways to add persimmons to your diet.

- Eat them on their own
- Add sliced persimmon to salads
- Use instead of apples in pork dishes
- Bake healthy muffins or quick breads
- Add to oatmeal or granola
- Roast persimmons for a healthy dessert

If you've ever had a few too many drinks on a night out, you know what the next morning can bring. The nausea, headache, parched mouth, and fatigue are telltale signs you've got a serious hangover.

## What Causes a Hangover?

Though other chemicals in your drink – or drinks – of choice contribute to your hangover, alcohol is the primary culprit. And it has many ways of making you miserable. Despite how often hangovers happen, little research exists to explain exactly why. Here’s what we do know about alcohol’s effects on the body and how it may bring on a hangover.

- **Immune response.** Alcohol causes your immune system to release cytokines, which are proteins that help control [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) in your body. Those cytokines appear to trigger many hangover symptoms, such as headache, fatigue, nausea, and more. They might even contribute to blacking out, or lapses in memory that can happen when you drink too much. They also may determine just how severe your hangover will be.

- **Inflammation.** Part of your immune response to drinking alcohol, inflammation may cause some of your hangover symptoms, such as feeling generally unwell.

- **Dehydration.** Alcohol disrupts communication between your brain and your kidneys. So, instead of retaining fluids the way you normally would, you have to pee more. That fluid loss leads to mild dehydration, which brings on symptoms like thirst, fatigue, and headache, which are common with hangovers. But the evidence that dehydration is truly linked to hangovers is lacking.

- **Stomach irritation.** Alcohol makes your stomach produce more acid. It also prevents your stomach from emptying normally. The result: stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting.

- **Low blood sugar.** When you drink, your body produces more lactic acid. That in turn curbs your body's production of [blood sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes). When that happens, you may feel fatigued, shaky, sweaty, and hungry. This happens more often in people with alcohol use disorder.

- **Lost sleep.** Alcohol is a sedative, so it may help you fall asleep quickly. But it also disrupts your sleep cycle. You get less deep, restorative sleep, so you wake up feeling poorly rested.

- **Blood vessel dilation.** Alcohol causes your blood vessels to dilate, or widen. This process, called vasodilation, lowers your blood pressure temporarily. For some people, this can cause a headache, a common symptom of a hangover.

- **Congeners.** Congeners are byproducts that are in alcoholic beverages as a result of distilling and fermenting. They contribute to the taste and smell of wine, liquor, and other alcoholic beverages. They also may make your hangover worse. This may be especially true if you drink dark liquors, like bourbon and brandy. They have more congeners than vodka, gin, and other clear alcohols.

- **Acetaldehyde in your body.** When your liver breaks down the alcohol in your system, a toxic chemical called acetaldehyde gets produced. A rise in inflammation in many of your organs follows.


## How Long Does a Hangover Last?

You likely want to know how to cure a hangover fast, but there’s only so much you can do to shorten how long you feel the symptoms of one.

You’ll start feeling the effects of a hangover hours after you stop drinking. Symptoms of a hangover can be mild or serious, depending on how much and what you drank. You’ll feel the worst as your blood [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/what-is-alcohol-abuse) level goes back to normal. Hangover symptoms can linger for a day or sometimes longer.

## Hangover Cures

For almost as long as humans have had hangovers, we've tried to cure them with remedies that run the gamut, from vitamin B to pickle juice. Some hangover treatments work better than others, but none are an actual cure. The only way to avoid a hangover is to limit how much you drink or to not drink alcohol at all. And if you find that hangovers are affecting your work or relationships, talk to your doctor about your drinking.

That said, a few hangover remedies can bring you relief from at least some of your symptoms. Here are a few tips to try:

**Drink water.**

A big glass of water might be the easiest hangover solution. Alcohol dehydrates you by boosting the amount of urine your kidneys make. You also lose fluid when you sweat, vomit, or have diarrhea after a night of bingeing. And alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you pee a lot and lose a lot of liquid. Dehydration causes symptoms like a dry mouth and headache.

Drinking water also slows the rate at which your body absorbs alcohol and keeps your overall blood alcohol level lower.

If you drink alcohol, drink water before you go to bed. It will curb the effects of booze in the morning. It's also smart to keep a bottle of water by your bedside. Another drink of water when you wake up will help keep you hydrated. Have a sports drink to replace the sodium, [potassium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-potassium), and other electrolytes you've lost from vomiting or diarrhea.

Some people say that getting fluids through an IV can help ease hangover symptoms. This method has the informal name of "drip bar." It can be pricey, and health insurance doesn't cover the bill. But there's no need to pay for IV fluids when you can drink a glass of water for free. Getting an IV insertion increases your risk that a vein may clot or become inflamed, or the injection site could become infected.

**Give yourself time and rest.**

You can ease some of your hangover symptoms with a variety of remedies, but the only way to cure a hangover is to give it time to go away on its own. There’s a lot that your body has to do in order to feel better. It needs time to:

- Clear the toxins that were produced when your body broke down the alcohol you drank
- Rehydrate
- Heal the irritated tissue in your gut
- Return your immune system as well as your brain activity to normal

You should plan to make this time as restful as possible. Though you are no longer drunk, you won’t be at the top of your game as you recuperate, so take it easy.

**Drink Korean pear juice.**

While most over-the-counter hangover remedies won’t help much, there’s one supplement that may do you some good – but you'll have to plan ahead. [Korean pear (Asian pear) juice](https://www.webmd.com/balance/hangover-cure#2-3) is an old-school hangover remedy. Research shows that drinking about 7½ ounces helps lower blood alcohol levels and makes hangovers less intense. The catch is that you need to drink it _before_ you have alcohol. Drinking it afterward won't work.

Researchers say Korean pears might work with your body's chemistry to break down alcohol faster. The extract has a protein that curbs the inflammation you can get from drinking too much. That may help hold off a hangover. Only a couple of studies have been done, which is far from proof that this hangover remedy works. But if you can find Korean pear juice at your local supermarket, it doesn't hurt to try a glass before you go out drinking.

**Take ginseng.**

This root has been a feature of Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Herbalists use it to treat everything from stress to asthma. In one small study, a drink made from red ginseng cut down hangover symptoms.

A different herb that goes by a similar name, Siberian ginseng extract, also improved hangover symptoms like headache, dizziness, and stomachache. But the Siberian type isn't the ginseng used in Chinese medicine.

Ginseng is safe for most people. Check with your doctor before using it if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. Some evidence suggests it might affect blood sugar and blood pressure levels.

**Eat carbs.**

Alcohol lowers your blood sugar. That may explain the dizziness and shaking some people get with a hangover. Your brain needs carbs for fuel. Have a couple of slices of wheat toast or a few whole-grain crackers to bring those [blood sugar levels](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes) back up to normal. You'll give yourself an energy boost, too.

**Take** _**Phyllanthus amarus**_ **extract.**

This medicinal herb grows along tropical coasts. It treats liver, kidney, and stomach illnesses. In one small study, taking _Phyllanthus amarus_ extract twice a day for 10 days helped lower blood alcohol levels, ease hangover symptoms, and improve mood in regular drinkers.

You can find extracts made from this herb online and in health food stores. Some of these products go by the name "stone breaker" herb. That's because it may help lower your chances of getting kidney stones.

**Take a pain reliever.**

An over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever will calm a pounding headache. Just be careful. They come with their own risks.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly available pain relievers that should help with your hangover headache. But they can irritate the lining of your stomach and worsen your nausea if you take more than the recommended dose. Common NSAIDs include:

- Ibuprofen
- Naproxen sodium
- Aspirin

Acetaminophen is another popular pain reliever. But it can damage your liver if you take it while you have alcohol in your system. It’s best to avoid it during a hangover.

**Drink caffeine – in moderation.**

If you don’t already drink coffee regularly, don’t down a cup in hopes of relieving your hangover. It may make things worse. Why? A few reasons.

- **Caffeine is a diuretic.** That means you’ll pee more when you drink it. If you’re already dehydrated from your night out, your cup of coffee could make that worse by slowing down the rehydration process.

- **Caffeine can worsen headaches.** Your morning cup temporarily narrows your blood vessels and increases your blood pressure. That’s a recipe for a worse headache than what you woke up with.


If coffee is part of your morning routine, go ahead and have a small cup. Otherwise, you risk a caffeine withdrawal [headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-basics).

**Use caution before taking hangover supplements and vitamins.**

Don’t get your hopes up that you’ll find a cure or preventive for your hangover in the supplements aisle. There’s very little research that shows supplements and vitamins help you feel better. Keep that warning in mind when shopping for any of the following examples:

- **B vitamins and zinc.** In a small 2019 study, people whose diet contained more B vitamins and zinc had less severe hangovers.

- **Kamishoyosan (KSS).** This traditional Japanese remedy includes ginger, brown sugar, and tangerine extract. It made hangovers less severe when taken before drinking alcohol, according to a 2010 Japanese study that included only 10 adults.


Some products marketed as hangover cures may be dangerous. They may contain unsafe amounts of vitamins and other ingredients. And they have not been evaluated by the FDA. In fact, the FDA has called out makers of so-called hangover cures for marketing unapproved concoctions. Use caution if you experiment with any anti-hangover supplements.

**Beware the 'hair of the dog.'**

The idea behind this popular hangover remedy is that taking another drink will ease the effects of the last few you had. The name comes from an old folk tale that says the way to treat a [dog bite](https://www.webmd.com/pets/dogs/dog-bites) is to cover the wound with hair taken from the dog that bit you.

When you drink, alcohol holds back a brain chemical called glutamate. That causes your brain to make more and more of it. When the alcohol wears off, you have a bunch of it floating around in your brain. It may be to blame for hangover symptoms like crankiness, headaches, nausea, and fatigue.

Down another drink the next morning, and you'll hold off the glutamate all over again. Your hangover symptoms may improve. But it won't last. The truth is, drinking again will just throw your body back into the same destructive cycle without giving it time to heal. Experts don't suggest trying this method.

**Don't light up and drink.**

For some people, the two go together. But you may pay the price.

Studies show that if you smoke cigarettes while you drink, you may get a worse hangover. Researchers don't know why, but they think it may have to do with how nicotine works on your nervous system.

## How to Cure Hangover Nausea

Feeling sick to your stomach is a hallmark hangover symptom. You can help your stomach feel better by eating bland foods that are high in carbohydrates. These include:

- Bananas
- Rice
- Applesauce
- Toast, like bagels and bread
- Crackers

It’s best to avoid greasy, heavy food, though you do want to eat a decent-sized breakfast to help restore your blood sugar level and relieve dehydration. To get more water into your system via breakfast, think fruits like watermelon, strawberries, and cantaloupe.

Speaking of water: Drinking water when you get up will help you rehydrate. But sip, don’t gulp. Flooding your stomach with water will only make it more upset. Also, drink room-temperature [water](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-water). Ice water won’t be as gentle on your stomach. Sports drinks, coconut water, and electrolyte-infused drinks also help with hydration.

Sipping ginger tea or chewing on a bit of dried ginger may help relieve your nausea.

## How to Cure Hangover Headache

Here are a few things to try to ease your aching head:

**Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).** Available over the counter, these painkillers will make your head feel better. They include:

- Ibuprofen
- Naproxen sodium
- Aspirin

Don’t reach for acetaminophen. It can damage your liver when mixed with alcohol.

**Water.** Dehydration can cause headaches, so drink some water. But go slowly so you don’t upset your stomach.

**Carbs**. Drinking lowers your blood sugar, which fuels your brain, and this could contribute to your headache. Carbohydrates in food can help boost your blood sugar back to normal. Try bland foods that are easy on your stomach, like toast and crackers, and drink some juice.

## How to Cure a Hangover Fast

If only you could. There’s simply no cure other than time for a hangover. Figure you’ll feel bad for at least 8 hours and maybe a full 24 hours. That said, you can help yourself feel a bit better by doing the following:

**Rehydrate with water or an electrolyte-rich sports drink.** Drink slowly so you won’t further upset your stomach.

**Take an OTC pain medication for your headache, such as ibuprofen or aspirin.** But remember: Avoid acetaminophen (like [Tylenol](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tylenol-acetaminophen-poisoning)). It may cause liver damage if you still have alcohol in your system.

**Eat.** Food will help restore your blood sugar and can help you feel better. Eat crackers, toast, or other bland, carb-rich foods that are easy on your stomach.

**Take a nap.** Alcohol messes with your sleep, and that lack of rest leaves you fatigued.

## Hangover Prevention

There are a number of things that you can do to prevent or at least limit hangovers.

- **Drink less.** Depending on how sensitive you are to alcohol, the only way to prevent a hangover may be to avoid drinking altogether. Some people have a hangover after a single drink. On the flipside, some people don’t get hungover no matter how much they drink. (If that's you, it doesn’t mean you should drink to excess!) So, if you don’t want a hangover, know your limits and don’t cross them.

- **Don’t drink on an empty stomach.** You want food in your belly because it slows the absorption of alcohol into your system. Have a sizable meal before your evening out. This may tamp down the booze’s effects on your body.

- **Drink water.** Drink a glass of water after every glass of beer or other [alcoholic beverage](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/cholesterol-and-alcohol) you toss back. This will help you avoid dehydration. It also may keep you from overdoing it with the alcohol.

- **Slow your pace.** Limit yourself to one drink per hour. That gives your body time to process the alcohol and may keep you from getting drunk. Going slow is especially important if you’re drinking sparkling wine or other carbonated alcoholic beverages. Those bubbles can boost the rate at which your body absorbs alcohol.

- **Steer clear of darker alcohols.** Remember the congeners mentioned above? Bourbon, scotch, brandy, tequila, dark beers, and red wines contain large amounts of these chemical compounds, which cause more severe hangovers. Choose gin, vodka, light beer, or white wine instead. You’ll likely wake up feeling less miserable.


## Takeaways

Hangovers are not inevitable if you drink. If you focus on moderation, stay hydrated, eat a healthy-sized meal, and drink slowly, you should be fine. But if you find yourself feeling miserable the next morning, drink some water, take an aspirin if you need one, crawl back into bed to catch up on sleep, and, above all, be patient. You’ll get better.

## Hangover Cure FAQs

- **How do you make a hangover go away faster?**

You can't. Time is the only cure. The best you can do is ease the symptoms somewhat and wait it out.

- **How do I stop feeling sick from a hangover?**

Bland foods like toast and crackers, ginger tea, and sipping room-temperature water can help ease your upset stomach.

- **Can anything really help with a hangover?**

A variety of remedies can help you feel a bit better, like over-the-counter pain medications for your headache and eating bland food to settle your stomach, but your [hangover](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hangover-remedies-treatments) likely will be with you all day. Take a nap if you can to restore lost rest and to pass the time.

- **What drink helps with a hangover?**

Water. It’s close at hand and helps relieve dehydration. You also can try electrolyte-rich sports drinks, juice, broth, and other liquids that your stomach can tolerate. Avoid drinking more alcohol.

## What Is a Prostate Massage?

[Prostate](https://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/understanding-prostate-cancer-symptoms) massage is a way to empty fluids from your prostate ducts. This therapy might offer some health benefits, or your doctor might use it to diagnose a problem. But it’s not something doctors usually recommend or use for testing or treatment.

The prostate is a small gland about the size of a golf ball between the base of the [penis](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/how-an-erection-occurs) and the rectum. Its main job is to make the fluid, also called [semen](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/marks-semen-analysis), that helps [sperm](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/sperm-and-semen-faq) travel and survive.

Massaging the prostate empties your prostate ducts of that fluid. To do the procedure, your doctor will slide a gloved finger into your rectum, and then massage or press on the prostate from there. It may feel slightly uncomfortable, but it doesn’t take long.

## Conditions Prostate Massage Might Help

Although studies are limited, prostate massage may be helpful in some medical situations and with some health conditions.

**Prostatitis**

[Prostatitis](https://www.webmd.com/men/prostatitis) is swelling and [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) of the prostate gland. It can cause symptoms such as pain when you pee or ejaculate and pain around your groin and pelvis.

A doctor might do a prostate massage to diagnose the condition. They can test the fluid that comes from your prostate ducts to see what’s causing the problem.

Although the most common treatments for prostatitis are [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cm/rm-quiz-antibiotics-myths-facts) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( [NSAIDs](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/features/pain-relief-how-nsaids-work)), prostate massage is another option. It can help ease pressure and swelling by releasing fluids that build up in the prostate. Small studies have found that massaging the area several times a week, along with taking antibiotics, can ease pain and pressure.

**Diagnosing a medical condition**

Sometimes, a doctor might do a prostate massage during a prostate exam. The purpose is to get some fluid that can be examined under a microscope to look for signs of an infection or other problem.

**Erection problems**

The main [treatments for erectile dysfunction](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/erectile-dysfunction-treatment) include medications, pumps, shots, and implants. Lifestyle changes that can help treat the condition include getting more [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm), eating a healthy diet, and doing pelvic floor exercises. Some people say they experience increased sexual pleasure and can ejaculate more easily after prostate massage, though there isn’t scientific proof to back up those claims.

**Urine flow**

Your urethra -- the thin tube that drains your [bladder](https://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/types-of-urinary-incontinence) \-\- is surrounded by your prostate. So, a swollen prostate can affect your [urine](https://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/truth-about-urine) flow. You might have a weak flow of urine or incomplete emptying after peeing (you may feel like you still need to go after you pee, but nothing comes out).

Prostate massage might ease swelling in the area, easing pressure on the urethra.

## When Would a Doctor Give a Prostate Massage?

One of the main reasons a doctor will give a prostate massage is if they think you might have prostatitis. If you have prostatitis, your prostate becomes swollen, inflamed, and painful. Massaging your prostate will cause it to release fluid into the urethra, the tube that empties the bladder. Your doctor will collect the fluid and send it to a lab. A lab technician will study the fluid under a microscope to look for signs of an infection or other problem that’s causing your symptoms.

Less often, a doctor might perform a prostate massage to treat prostatitis or an enlarged prostate. A few small studies show that prostate massage could help ease symptoms, especially when combined with other treatments.

## How to Massage the Prostate

If you're interested in prostate massage, you can do it yourself (known as a manual prostate massage). Or, you can have a partner massage your prostate. The technique is simple, though it may take some practice. If you have prostatitis, ask your doctor if it’s OK for you to have a prostate massage. They may be able to teach you the proper massage technique.

**Manual prostate massage**

To massage your prostate, first get the equipment you’ll need, including a non-latex glove or condom and lubricant gel, such as K-Y Jelly.

Before you begin, it’s a good idea to empty your bowel and bladder. Put on the glove or slip the condom onto a finger. (If you choose not to use a glove or condom, be sure your fingernails are clean, well-trimmed, and filed.) Apply plenty of lubricant gel to the finger you will use. Then, follow these steps:

- Bend over a table or get down on all fours.
- Insert the lubricated finger into your anus.
- Feel around with the tip of your finger for your prostate, which will feel like a small ball.
- When you find your prostate, gently press on it for a few seconds, then release your finger.
- Repeat this process 5 to 10 times, in the same spot or different parts of the prostate, if possible.
- Some doctors prefer to use a stroking motion, moving the finger from the edge of the prostate to the center.

As an alternative, some people prefer an external prostate massage. Instead of inserting your finger into your anus, you stroke and apply pressure to the perineum, which is the small patch of flesh between your anus and genitals.

**What to use for prostate massage**

You or a partner can use a gloved and lubricated finger to massage your prostate. However, some people prefer to use a prostate massager device. You may be able to purchase a prostate massage device in a pharmacy, though they're also widely available online. Some prostate massagers vibrate. If you choose one of the latter, some doctors recommend choosing a device that produces sonic waves, which are vibrations made by high-frequency sounds that humans cannot hear. External prostate massagers are also available.

When shopping for a prostate massager, only purchase a reputable company's product that is specifically designed for this use. Some retailers sell sex toys that are marketed as prostate massagers, but may not be safe for this use. Pay attention to the material used and make sure your lubricant works with the massager. For example, don't use a silicone-based lube with a silicone massager, because it could wear down the material over time. Water-based lubricants work well with most products.

**How to use a prostate massager**

Use a prostate massager in a similar way that you would use a gloved finger to perform this procedure. First, apply plenty of lubricant gel to the tip of the massager. When you're in your preferred position (usually either bent over a table or on all fours), insert the tip of the massager into your anus. Gently probe with the massager until you find your prostate. Apply on-and-off pressure to your prostate with the tip as you would with a finger.

Devices are also available for external prostate massage. You sit on top of these devices, which apply gentle pressure to the perineum.

**Prostate massage with a partner**

Your partner may be willing to massage your prostate or you may offer to perform the procedure for them. If you’re receiving a prostate massage, you may want to wash your anus with gentle soap and water first. The technique for massaging a partner’s prostate is similar to performing a manual prostate massage. The person receiving the massage can bend over a table or get on all fours, though you can also try lying on your back. The person performing the massage inserts a well-lubricated finger (gloved or not) into the anus and finds the prostate, applying on-and-off pressure.

**Prostate massage for sexual pleasure**

Some people find prostate massage to be sexually arousing. A prostate massage may cause you to have an erection and even an orgasm, though you may not ejaculate, which is entirely normal. If you decide to try prostate massage for sexual pleasure with a partner, the same rules apply: Apply plenty of lube to your finger or device and be gentle. Insert slowly, working your finger or device a few inches at a time, letting your partner get accustomed to the feeling. And be sure to communicate: If you’re receiving a prostate massage and want to stop for any reason, speak up.

## Prostate Massage Risks

Some people choose to give themselves a prostate massage, whether for medical reasons or sexual pleasure. But there's a chance you can hurt yourself if you massage your prostate too roughly. It shouldn't be painful.

Also, while doctors may use prostate massage to produce fluids that help with diagnosing prostatitis, some people shouldn't have one. Specifically, if you have a severe form of prostatitis caused by a bacterial infection (called acute bacterial prostatitis), you shouldn't get a prostate massage, as it could make you very ill.

If you need a prostate massage for health reasons, it’s best to get it from your doctor, who knows the proper technique.

## Takeaways

Prostate massage helps release fluid from the prostate ducts. A doctor may study this fluid under a microscope to diagnose prostatitis and other conditions. You might try prostate massage to help treat symptoms of prostatitis and enlarged prostate, though scientific evidence is limited. Even without a medical need, some people find prostate massage to be sexually arousing. You can learn to massage your prostate or have a partner do it for you, though it’s wise to check with your doctor first.

Fruits are powerhouses of nutrients, packed with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a variety of disease-fighters called phytochemicals. The USDA recommends that most adults should eat about two cups of fruit daily, thanks to evidence that it lowers your risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and other health threats.

However, fruits get their sweet taste from a natural form of sugar called fructose. Your body quickly converts this carbohydrate to glucose, which can cause your blood sugar levels to rise -- just what you’re trying to avoid when managing diabetes.

That doesn’t mean you need to stay away from fruits, however. In fact, these delicious foods should be a routine part of your diet. But what’s the best fruit for diabetes? Fortunately, with a little planning and careful choosing, you can enjoy a variety of fruits.

## How Do Fruits Affect Blood Sugar?

When you eat fruits, your body absorbs their fructose. However, your cells can’t use fructose as a source of energy, as they prefer the form of blood sugar called glucose. To fix this problem, enzymes in your liver convert much of the fructose in fruit to glucose, which is then released into your bloodstream, causing your blood sugar to rise.

However, fruits also contain fiber, which helps to slow down this converted glucose as it enters your blood. That’s just one reason why fruits make for a healthier snack or dessert than other carb-rich foods and beverages such as candy and soda pop, which lack fiber. Still, if you have diabetes, you need to manage your carb intake as part of your overall plan for keeping your blood sugar in check.

If you’re having trouble keeping your blood sugar under control, let your doctor know right away.

## Benefits of Fruits for People With Diabetes

If you have diabetes, fruits aren't off-limits. In fact, they have many benefits for people dealing with this condition.

**Reduced risk for cardiovascular disease.** If you have diabetes, your risk for a heart attack or stroke is twice that of the average person. You also have an increased risk of developing these conditions at a younger age than someone who doesn’t have diabetes. The nutrients in fruits help guard against heart attacks, strokes, and other forms of cardiovascular disease by protecting blood vessels, lowering cholesterol and blood pressure, and making blood less likely to clot, among other benefits.

**Better control of blood sugar and weight.** The fiber in fruits not only helps prevent blood sugar spikes by slowing digestion but also makes you feel fuller, which can help you keep a healthy weight. Also, if you don’t have diabetes, including frequent servings of fruit in your daily meal plan can help keep the condition at bay, research suggests. One study that included more than 200,000 people found that eating at least five servings of fruits rich in a chemical called anthocyanin (such as blueberries, apples, and pears) each week reduced the risk for type 2 diabetes by 23%.

**Better overall health.** The fiber in fruits aids digestion in another way, by helping ensure that you have regular bowel movements. And since water makes up much of the content of fruit, it helps you stay hydrated, too.

## Fruits for Diabetes: How Much Can I Eat?

One serving of fruit has 15 grams of carbs. But the serving size can be very different depending on the type of fruit. For example, you get 15 grams of carbs from:

- 1/2 medium apple or banana
- 1 cup blackberries or raspberries
- 3/4 cup blueberries
- 1 1/4 cup whole strawberries
- 1 cup cubed honeydew melon
- 1/8 cup raisins

Carbs aren’t the only number to keep in mind. The glycemic index (GI) measures how a food affects your blood sugar. Foods that are low on the scale raise it slowly. Those high on the scale raise it quickly.

Eating mostly low-GI foods can help you keep control of your blood sugar. But they may not always be good for you. A candy bar and a cup of brown rice can have the same GI value. Be sure to keep nutrition in mind when choosing what to eat.

While the GI is a useful number to know, it doesn’t always give an accurate picture of how much a food will raise your blood sugar. That’s because the GI doesn’t tell you how many carbohydrates you’re actually getting when you eat a specific food. So, nutrition experts developed a metric called the glycemic load (GL), which combines portion size and GI to give you a better idea of how much a food actually raises your blood sugar. For example, an orange has a GI of 52 but a glycemic load of 4.4, which is low. A candy bar with a GI of 55 may have a GL of 22.1, which is high.

## Healthy Ways to Eat Fruits

Small steps can make a big difference in your blood sugar levels. Be sure to:

- Watch your portion sizes, especially with dried fruit. For example, two tablespoons of raisins have the same amount of carbs as a small apple.
- Choose fresh or frozen fruit when you can. Processed fruits such as applesauce and canned fruit in syrup or juice often have more carbs and can raise your blood sugar higher than fresh fruits.
- When you eat dried or processed fruit, check the label. Many have added sugar, and serving sizes can be very small.
- Go easy on the fruit juice. It’s high in carbs (8 ounces of apple juice has 29 grams of carbs). And it doesn’t have fiber to slow digestion and prevent blood sugar spikes such as whole fruit does. Research even links drinking lots of fruit juice to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.
- Spread your fruit out over the day. Instead of two servings for breakfast, have one at breakfast and another at lunch or as a snack.
- Combine fruit with other foods that contain fat and protein. Like fiber, these macronutrients help keep blood sugar from spiking when you eat carbs. Try spreading peanut butter on apple slices or eat berries with yogurt. The protein and fat will also help you feel full sooner, so you’ll eat less.

## Best Fruits for Diabetes

All fruits have vitamins, phytochemicals, and other things that make them good for you. But some are more likely to lower your chances of chronic disease:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fruit | Calories | Carbohydrates (grams) | Fiber (grams) |
| Blackberries (1 cup) | 64 | 14 | 7.6 |
| Tomatoes (1 cup, sliced or chopped) | 32 | 7 | 2 |
| Cherries (1 cup) | 74 | 19 | 2.5 |
| Nectarine (1, sliced) | 61 | 15 | 2.4 |
| Orange (1 medium) | 69 | 17 | 3 |
| Peach (1 cup, sliced) | 66 | 16 | 2.6 |
| Pear (1 medium) | 96 | 26 | 5 |
| Pomegranate (1 whole) | 105 | 26 | 1 |
| Strawberries (1 cup) | 46 | 11 | 3 |

**Are grapefruits good for people with diabetes?**

Grapefruit has many health benefits. It contains phytochemicals that fight heart disease, reduce inflammation, and strengthen the immune system. Grapefruit is a good choice if you have diabetes since it has a GI of 26. That’s low, which means eating a serving of grapefruit won’t cause a steep spike in your blood sugar.

## Other Low-GI Fruits for Diabetes

Several other varieties of fruits have a relatively mild effect on your blood sugar, making them great choices if you have diabetes. The fiber in fresh fruit helps keep most types low on the GI scale (55 or under). Examples include:

The fiber in fresh fruit helps keep most of them low on the GI scale (55 or under). Examples include:

- Apples (GI of 39)
- Bananas (GI of 55)
- Pears (GI of 30)
- Blueberries and raspberries (GI of 53)
- Cherries (GI of 20)
- Figs, pomegranates, and oranges (GI of 35)
- Grapes (GI of 45)
- Prunes (GI of 40)
- Strawberries (GI of 25)

## High-GI Fruits

A few fruits are on the moderate to higher end of the GI scale (55 or higher). These include:

- Dates (dried) (GI of 62)
- Mangoes (GI of 60)
- Pineapple (GI of 58)
- Raisins (GI of 66)
- Watermelon (GI of 76)

**Are apples high in sugar?**

Apples are relatively high in sugar, but they’re still a good choice. A large apple has about 25 grams of sugar, which is significantly higher than the sugar content of a banana or orange, for example. However, apples are also high in fiber, which helps slow the release of sugar into the bloodstream. That’s why eating an apple won’t cause a big surge in blood sugar.

## Takeaways

People who have diabetes are often under the impression that they should avoid fruits, as they contain sugar. However, just the opposite is true — enjoying these sweet, nutritious foods can help you lower your risk for many chronic diseases, without interfering with good control of your blood sugar. If you choose wisely and keep portion size in mind, you can include several servings of fruit in your daily meal plan.

## Best Fruits for Diabetes FAQs

**What fruits are good for diabetes?**

All fruits contain important nutrients, so it’s wise to eat a variety. However, some fruits have a relatively mild effect on blood sugar, including apples, cherries, oranges, pears, and strawberries.

**What fruit does not spike blood sugar?**

Any fruit you eat will cause your blood sugar to rise, but some only produce a small increase. Some fruits that do not cause a spike in blood sugar include apples, cherries, oranges, pears, and strawberries.

**What 10 foods should people with diabetes eat?**

Every person has their own food preferences, so if you have diabetes, work with your doctor or a registered dietitian to figure out what foods are best for you. The American Diabetes Association recommends these 10 Diabetes Superstar Foods:

- Avocados
- Beans and legumes
- Berries
- Citrus fruits
- Dark green leafy vegetables
- Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and sardines
- Milk
- Nuts
- Whole grains, such as whole oats and quinoa
- Yogurt

**What should you eat to reverse diabetes?**

There are no foods that reverse diabetes. Eating less food and losing weight may reverse diabetes, however. Reducing your intake of food and drinks with added sugars, red meat, and processed foods while eating more fruits, vegetables, and fiber may help.

**Are kiwis good for people with diabetes?**

Kiwis can be a good choice if you have diabetes. A typical kiwi has a glycemic index of 39, which means it causes only a modest increase in blood sugar levels.

## What Is the Luteal Phase?

The luteal phase is the part of your menstrual cycle that prepares your uterus for pregnancy by thickening your uterine lining. Typically it happens around day 15 of a 28-day cycle, and it’s over once your period starts.

A menstrual cycle has four phases:

1. Menses phase. This phase starts on day 1 of your period, when you begin shedding your uterine lining. It ends when you stop bleeding.
2. Follicular phase. This phase also starts on the first day of your period, overlapping with menses, but continues until you ovulate.
3. Ovulation phase. This phase happens when your ovaries release an egg, typically around day 14 of a 28-day cycle.
4. Luteal phase. This phase starts with ovulation and ends with the first day of your period.

**Luteal phase length**

A luteal phase is the “second half” of your period, starting right after ovulation happens. Doctors consider an average period to be 28 days long. A normal luteal phase lasts about 12 to 14 days, from day 15 to day 28. But like a menstrual cycle, this can vary. Normal menstrual cycles range from 21 to 35 days. Luteal phases that last 11 to 17 days are in the normal range.

**Short luteal phase**

If your luteal phase is 10 days or less, doctors call it a short luteal phase. With this, you get your period 10 days or less from ovulation. Your uterine lining can’t grow thick enough in this amount of time for an embryo to implant and grow correctly. When you have a short luteal phase, it can be difficult to get pregnant.

A luteal phase that isn’t long enough to thicken your uterine lining enough for embryo support can also be a sign of a luteal phase dysfunction (LPD). This happens because your body doesn’t make as much of the hormone progesterone as it needs to so your uterine lining will grow.

Your doctor can use a blood test to check your progesterone levels, or they may want to do a biopsy of your uterine lining to help diagnose LPD.

**Long luteal phase**

A luteal phase that is longer than 18 days is a long luteal phase. You don’t get your period until 18 days after ovulation or longer. Not getting your period for 18 days or longer can be a sign that your egg was fertilized and you’re pregnant, but sometimes a long luteal phase can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

When you have PCOS, your periods are usually irregular and hard to predict. You may also have more body hair than normal, and your ovaries can be larger than normal and work abnormally. It can be hard to get pregnant when you have PCOS.

## What Happens During the Luteal Phase?

During the luteal phase, an egg leaves a small sac in your ovary called a follicle and starts to travel to your uterus through your fallopian tubes. The cells that made up that leftover follicle form what’s called the corpus luteum.

The corpus luteum is a key part of the luteal phase. It makes estrogen and progesterone, two hormones that signal certain changes in your menstrual cycle. The progesterone your corpus luteum makes controls two functions:

- Thickening the lining of your uterus (the endometrium) so that a fertilized egg can attach to it and begin to grow.
- Thickening your cervical mucus – the fluid your cervix makes – into a paste-like consistency.

Your progesterone levels are typically highest around 6 to 8 days after ovulation.

If the egg your follicle releases at ovulation isn’t fertilized, the corpus luteum dissolves. This decreases your progesterone and estrogen levels and you get your period. If you do get pregnant, the corpus luteum continues making progesterone for the first 12 weeks of your pregnancy until your placenta grows and takes over progesterone production. After that point, the corpus luteum dissolves.

Your body temperature also increases slightly at the beginning of your luteal phase just after ovulation. You won’t notice the change (it may be as small as 0.4 degrees F), but you can measure it using a special thermometer called a basal body thermometer. You take your temperature first thing in the morning before getting out of bed. Some people use this to help identify when they ovulate so they can increase their chances of getting pregnant.

## Luteal Phase Symptoms

Your luteal phase is when you typically experience symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. The change in your hormone levels can create physical and emotional issues.

Physical symptoms include:

- Sore breasts that are slightly swollen
- Bloating
- Retaining fluids (edema, swelling)
- Constipation or diarrhea
- Headache
- Appetite changes
- Skin changes, such as breakouts
- Muscle pain (cramps)
- Joint pain
- Feeling overly tired

Emotionally, you may experience:

- Depression
- Anxiety
- Feeling tense
- Insomnia or oversleeping
- Changes in sexual interest and desire
- Irritability
- Hostility and outbursts of anger
- Mood swings
- Difficulty concentrating
- Crying spells
- Withdrawal from social events

Some people have a more severe set of symptoms during their luteal phase. This is known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Doctors used to call this late luteal dysphoric disorder (LLDD). Symptoms are similar to PMS but worse. They happen during the last week of the luteal phase and end once your period starts.

**Luteal phase discharge**

Your cervical mucus, or discharge, changes throughout your menstrual cycle. Just before you ovulate, at the end of your follicular phase, it’s clear and slippery (if you were to look at it and feel it between your fingers). This helps sperm swim up to the egg. The mucus is like this because of the level of estrogen in your body.

Once ovulation happens, your discharge changes. In the luteal phase it thickens and dries up, so your cervical mucus is more like a paste. A thick mucus serves as a barrier from bacteria in case pregnancy begins and a fertilized egg needs protection.

## Thriving During Your Luteal Phase

The change in hormones during your luteal phase can sometimes cause unpleasant or uncomfortable symptoms, but there are ways you can comfort and care for yourself as you await your period.

First, keep track of your periods so you can better prepare for when it will arrive each time and have a record of how the different phases affect you. Then, put a plan of action in place when you reach your luteal phase:

- Keep moving. It’s tempting to let fatigue and bloating and pain keep you on the couch, but when you can, take a walk, do yoga, or engage in some other form of physical activity that feels good to you. Getting at least 30 minutes a day of exercise not only improves your mood, but it can also help reduce certain PMS symptoms.
- De-stress. Make intentional efforts to relax your body to help lower tension in your muscles and mind. Practice deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation. You may have fewer headaches and better sleep as a result.
- Prioritize quality sleep. Be sure you’re getting the ZZZs you need. Keep a regular bedtime and wake time, keep your room cool and dark, and put away screens well before going to bed.
- Ask about complementary therapy. See what your doctor recommends to help treat symptoms such as cramps and bloating. Some may be over-the-counter medications, but other options such as acupuncture or supplements may be options, too.

**Luteal phase foods**

Your body needs more of some nutrients and less of others when you’re in the luteal phase. Heed these diet dos and don’ts:

- Eat small portions, more often. Bloating creates a feeling of fullness. You can help ease it by not filling up with three big, heavy meals a day. Snack on smaller meals five to six times a day instead.
- Skip the salt. During the luteal phase, you tend to hold on to fluid, and extra salt in your diet can make that worse.
- Go for complex carbs. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains give your body a mood boost. Carbs raise your serotonin levels, a feel-good chemical in your brain. Plus, the fiber in them helps keep you regular.
- Raise your calcium levels. Calcium may ease your mood swings, headache, bloating, and irritability. You get it in milk, cheese, yogurt, and calcium-fortified foods.
- Bump up magnesium. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good sources of magnesium, which may help keep bloating at bay and relieve breast tenderness.
- Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Both can mess with your sleep, and alcohol can have depressive effects.

## Takeaways

- The luteal phase is the part of your period that takes place after ovulation and ends when your period starts.
- A typical luteal phase lasts 12 to 14 days, but it may be slightly shorter or longer. Abnormally short and long luteal phases are the result of hormone imbalances.
- During a typical luteal phase, your uterine lining matures and thickens so that it can support a fertilized egg to grow. If there is no fertilized egg, your uterus sheds the lining and your period starts, ending your luteal phase.
- Your luteal phase is when you may experience symptoms of PMS, such as bloating, breast tenderness, mood swings, and abdominal cramps.

## Luteal Phase FAQs

**Can you get pregnant in the luteal phase?**

Your luteal phase is exactly when you get pregnant. This is when a sperm meets the egg your follicle just released. However, if you’re trying to conceive, you shouldn’t wait until after ovulation (when the luteal phase starts) to have sex because your fertility window closes 12-24 hours after this happens. You raise your chances of pregnancy if you have sex in the 5-day span before your ovulation during the follicular phase.

**What are the moods in the luteal phase?**

It’s common for people to experience irritability, depression, and anxiety during the luteal phase. Your mood may swing from one feeling to another without warning. Sometimes ovulation can increase feelings of sexual desire, but this may decrease as progesterone rises, leaving desire lower for the rest of your luteal phase.

**Why am I so tired during the luteal phase?**

Studies show progesterone can increase feelings of fatigue. Since your progesterone levels are elevated during your luteal phase, tiredness is likely to follow.

**How do you fight fatigue in the luteal phase?**

Take advantage of your most energetic time of day to get exercise in. Not only is it good for overall health, but a brisk walk, bike ride, swim, or other aerobic activity can help reduce feelings of fatigue and boost your energy reserves. Don’t rely on caffeine as a crutch for tired times, either. Caffeine can disrupt nighttime sleep, robbing you of the rest you need.

**What do you crave in the luteal phase period?**

Studies on the later part of the luteal phase show you’re likely to have a hankering for sweet, fat-filled, and rich foods. Think fatty foods and sugary treats like baked goods, candy bars, and chips.

**Which foods should be avoided during the luteal phase?**

Salty foods can contribute to your body’s fluid retention, so it’s best to steer clear of sodium-rich snacks and the salt shaker. Food and drinks with high caffeine content can mess with your sleep and may make you more irritable.

**Does your face change during the luteal phase?**

Some studies show that the shape and texture of your face may slightly change in the luteal phase. Studies note that changes may include the lower part of your face becoming fuller, your nose getting broader, and your eyebrows getting more pronounced.

## What Is Ashwagandha?

Ashwagandha, or _Withania somnifera_, is an herb native to Asia and Africa. Also called “Indian ginseng,” it’s been used in traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years to ease pain and inflammation, boost nutrition, and treat insomnia, along with other conditions.

Ashwagandha is also considered an [adaptogen](https://www.webmd.com/balance/adaptogens-what-to-know). That means it helps your body better manage stress. More research is needed on ashwagandha’s benefits, to confirm how well it works. But this herbal supplement might be helpful if you have stress and anxiety,  or trouble with sleep.

**Ashwagandha dosage**

There is no standard dose of ashwagandha, and people may take different amounts of the herb depending on what effect they are hoping for. Some studies have shown that the most effective doses might be between 500 and 600 milligrams a day, but people taking dosages as small as 120 milligrams a day have also reported benefits.

**When to take ashwagandha**

There is no standard time to take ashwagandha. Some studies had participants take it in the evening, after dinner. Others had people take it twice a day. You may need to try taking it at different times of the day and see what works best for you.

## Forms of Ashwagandha

You can take ashwagandha in several different forms, including powder, capsule, tablet, or gummy. What form you choose depends on what works best for your dosage and lifestyle.

**Ashwagandha powder**

Ashwagandha powder is a commonly available type of ashwagandha. The powder typically contains the herb’s dried root, leaf, or a combination of the two. The powder can be put into a capsule and swallowed as a pill, or it can be mixed into a drink with water, ghee (clarified butter), milk, or honey.

**Ashwagandha tablets**

Ashwagandha can also be taken in tablet form, though this is a less common form than capsules. Keep in mind that as with all herbal supplements, ashwagandha supplements are [dietary supplements](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-faq), and so they are regulated less strictly than medical drugs.

**Ashwagandha gummies**

Ashwagandha can also be taken as flavored gummies. This may be a good option for people who can’t swallow pills, and who find the taste of the powder to be unpleasant.

## Ashwagandha Benefits

**Ashwagandha for sleep**

Though research is still limited, one of the most popular uses for ashwagandha is as a sleep aid.

One study showed taking 300 milligrams of the herb two times a day improved sleep, and another found that people who took 120 milligrams of an ashwagandha extract reported a significant improvement in sleep quality.

A meta-analysis of five studies looked at ashwagandha’s impact on sleep in humans. It found that the herb had a small but significant impact on improving sleep, especially in people who had [insomnia](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/insomnia-symptoms-and-causes). The benefits were greatest when people took at least 600 milligrams of ashwagandha each day for 8 weeks or longer.

**Stress and anxiety relief**

There are several human studies on ashwagandha’s stress-relieving properties. A review of seven studies found the supplement helped lower stress levels. One study showed adults who took 300 milligrams of ashwagandha daily for 8 weeks had lower levels of anxiety and fatigue. They also had an easier time concentrating than adults who had psychotherapy, or talk therapy, for the same amount of time. In another study, adults who took 300 milligrams of ashwagandha daily for 8 weeks had less stress and fewer stress-related food cravings than adults who took a [placebo](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-the-placebo-effect) (fake pill) instead.

Another study found that people who took 225 milligrams of ashwagandha a day had lower levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, in their saliva compared to people who were taking a placebo.

Other studies have shown that people taking ashwagandha report improvements in stress levels and increased feelings of calm.

**Effects on cancer**

Several studies have shown ashwagandha has compounds that may help fight certain types of cancer. Researchers aren’t sure how, but extracts in the herb seem to limit the activity of cancer cells in breast, colon, prostate, ovarian, lung, and brain cancers in the lab. It does the same for thyroid, gastrointestinal, cervix, and skin (melanoma) cancers. Almost all of these studies have been done on cancer cells or animals with cancer, and they haven’t been proven in humans yet. Ashwagandha is considered safe to use with traditional cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. Experts say it may ease some side effects, such as a weak immune system.

**For neurodegenerative diseases**

Studies show ashwagandha can slow, stop, and possibly reverse certain types of nerve cell damage. That’s what leads to diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s. Ashwagandha may also be neuroprotective, meaning it may help prevent the development of some neurodegenerative diseases. Still, almost all of the studies on ashwagandha and nerve cell damage in the brain have been done on animals or animal cells, and more research is needed to know if ashwagandha might have any effect on these diseases.

**Ashwagandha for arthritis**

One study found ashwagandha eased [arthritis-related symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/understanding-arthritis-symptoms) including pain and joint swelling in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Another study showed that ashwagandha had anti-inflammatory effects on human cartilage cells with osteoarthritis. A third study found that it helped adults with general knee joint pain and discomfort.

**Ashwagandha and exercise**

A meta-analysis of 12 studies looking at ashwagandha’s impacts on exercise found that ashwagandha supplements were more effective than placebos in improving physical performance for healthy people. One study found that taking ashwagandha daily can help reduce fatigue and improve recovery after exercise.

Another study found healthy young adults who took 500 milligrams of ashwagandha daily for 8 weeks had more speed and strength during exercise than people who took a placebo. They also breathed better, taking in more oxygen.

A small study also found that people who took ashwagandha root supplements had more significant gains in muscle mass than people who took a placebo pill and performed the same resistance exercises.

**Ashwagandha and sperm**

Some small studies have found that ashwagandha may improve sperm count, volume, and motility, or how efficiently a sperm moves. More studies are needed, however, to understand how ashwagandha might impact sperm.

## Ashwagandha Side Effects

Like any medication, ashwagandha can cause side effects. These can include:

- Stomach upset
- Nausea or vomiting
- [Diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea)
- Drowsiness
- Headache

**Ashwagandha weight gain**

Weight gain is not a commonly reported side effect of ashwagandha. Ashwagandha has not been studied as an aid to gain or lose weight, though a small study did find that it may help reduce food cravings in adults who are chronically stressed.

## Is Ashwagandha Safe?

Talk to your doctor before taking any herbal supplement. They could cause problems with other medications you’re taking, especially if these other drugs already make you tired. Although it is rare, some people have gotten [liver injuries](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-liver-failure) from taking ashwagandha supplements. In most cases, the liver heals itself within 1 to 3 months of discontinuing the supplement. Most studies of ashwagandha have only looked at people taking it for up to 3 months, so the herb's long-term effects aren’t known.

**If you’re pregnant**

Ashwagandha isn’t safe to take if you’re pregnant. High doses of it may cause a spontaneous abortion, meaning you could lose your pregnancy.

## Takeaways

Ashwagandha is a traditional Indian Ayurvedic herb with a long history of use. The most common way to take ashwagandha is as a powder, either in a capsule or mixed into a beverage. Studies have shown that ashwagandha may help improve sleep quality, aid in stress and [anxiety relief](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/natural-remedies-for-anxiety), and help improve joint pain, physical performance, and sperm health. As ashwagandha can cause some side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, and headache, it's best to talk to your doctor before taking this supplement.

## Ashwagandha FAQs

**Who should not take ashwagandha?**

People who are pregnant or who might be pregnant and people with preexisting liver disease should not take ashwagandha. If you have an autoimmune condition, your immune system is already overactive. You shouldn't take this herb, as it can stimulate your immune system even more.

**Does ashwagandha have side effects?**

Like any medication or supplement, ashwagandha may have side effects for some people. These side effects can include an upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, and headache.

## What Is Maca?

Sometimes known as Peruvian ginseng, maca comes from the root of a plant that grows in the Andes Mountains. The Indigenous people of Peru have used maca as both food and medicine for centuries.

Maca belongs to the same family of plants as turnips and broccoli. The root contains amino acids, iron, calcium, and several compounds unique to the maca plant. As an herbal medicine, it has been used to improve sexual function, fertility, and health.

## Health Benefits of Maca

Several animal studies have shown that maca increases libido and improves sexual performance. A few human studies have shown similar results, but more research is needed. Studies of other benefits of maca have been similarly inconclusive.

The health benefits that may result from using maca root and maca powder include:

**Erectile Function**

Maca powder is traditionally used to boost sexual performance, but [clinical trials](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/clincial-trial-guide-patients) showing improvement are scarce. In one study, men taking maca showed more erectile improvement than those who did not.

**Healthy Menopause**

Studies have shown that maca can reduce discomfort related to hormone levels in women who are postmenopausal. One study showed that this nutrient had an impact on hormone levels as women reported improvements in their symptoms.

**Female Sexuality**

Maca may improve sexual functioning in women who are taking antidepressants. More than half of those on two types of antidepressants report sexual dysfunction that affects their quality of life and relationships. In one study, maca improved sexual interest, arousal, [orgasm](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/video/video-female-orgasm), and satisfaction. Women who were postmenopausal showed the most positive results.

**Fertility**

To analyze male fertility, researchers studied men’s semen count, as well as sperm shape and ability to move. Results showed that maca may improve semen quality. But the evidence is inconclusive and the issue needs more research.

**Overall Health and Energy**

Some maca users say that it increases their energy, stamina, and overall health. In one study of people living in the Andes, researchers compared maca consumers with non-consumers. They analyzed the subjects using a variety of measures, including [lab tests](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/lab-test-results) and a test of leg strength. Those who used maca scored higher in some measures.

## Health Risks of Maca

Health authorities rate maca root and maca powder as generally safe, but some users have reported side effects. These include moodiness, cramping, stomach distress, and [insomnia](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/insomnia-symptoms-and-causes). In addition, some women say that maca affected their menstrual cycles. Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use maca as there is not enough information about its safety.

**Hormone-Sensitive Cancers**

Since maca seems to affect sex hormones, those with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid it. These cancers include ovarian, breast, endometrial, and uterine. In addition, those with fibroids in the uterus should not take it.

**Tainted Products**

Consumers should be especially careful about using supplements that claim to improve sexual performance. The FDA has found that some makers of these supplements have put drugs such as Viagra, [Cialis](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/cialis-levitra-staxyn-viagra-treat-ed), or Levitra in their products at occasionally dangerous amounts.

To avoid using tainted products, buy from a reputable retailer. The FDA also suggests avoiding products that claim to be fast-acting, come in single-use packages, or advertise using spam. Other red flags include package labels you are unable to read or packages that mimic FDA-approved products. Also, beware of any product that claims to be an alternative to FDA-approved drugs.

**Hidden Ingredients**

Herbal remedies for erectile dysfunction can be laced with other ingredients, according to the FDA. Some manufacturers add sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, to their products. [Sildenafil](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/chewable-medications) can cause serious side effects and should be used under a doctor's supervision. The FDA does not test all supplements. Consumers should look for products tested by a third-party agency. Some stores stock only supplements that are third-party tested.

**Medication Interactions**

Many people use herbal medicines, often without telling their doctors. This practice can be dangerous, as plant-based supplements like maca powder can interact with other drugs. Herb-drug interactions are rarer than once thought. Still, the risk is real – especially for older adults who are likely to take multiple medications.

## Amounts and Dosage

Maca is rated as possibly safe at doses up to 3 grams. The dosage depends upon your age and state of health. Scientists have not determined an appropriate range of doses, so you should consult your doctor before using maca.

Besides buying maca in tablet or capsule form, you can use maca powder in the kitchen. Some people add it to their smoothies, hot cereals, breakfast muffins, or beverages. If you use maca powder, you will get some nutritional value. One tablespoon contains small amounts of some minerals as well as:

- 1 gram of protein
- 6 grams of carbohydrates
- 2 grams of [fiber](https://www.webmd.com/diet/video/truth-about-fiber)

Intubation is a procedure that's used when you can't [breathe](https://www.webmd.com/lung/how-we-breathe) on your own. Your doctor puts a tube down your throat and into your windpipe to make it easier to get air into and out of your [lungs](https://www.webmd.com/lung/healthy-lungs-smokers-lungs). A machine called a ventilator pumps in air with extra oxygen. Then it helps you breathe out air that’s full of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is called mechanical ventilation. It helps keep your oxygen and CO2 at healthy levels.

## Why You Might Need It

The [drugs](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx) that put you to “sleep” during surgery ( [general anesthesia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-general-anesthesia)) may also hold down your breathing. Intubation lets a machine breathe for you. That’s why your anesthesiologist (the doctor who puts you to sleep for surgery) might intubate you.

Your doctor also may do it if you have an injury or illness that makes it hard to breathe. That’s because breathing provides oxygen that every cell in your body needs. If you don’t get enough, you can pass out, have [brain damage](https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-damage-symptoms-causes-treatments), and even die. Ventilation also helps you breathe out. This helps get rid of CO2 so that it doesn't build up in your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) and make it more acidic (respiratory acidosis). That can lead to other health problems.

Sometimes, even if you appear to be breathing normally and your blood oxygen levels look fine, you may need intubation. Your doctor might want to do it because you’re unconscious. You may have an illness or injury that’s quickly getting worse, or that weakens reflexes in your airway.

A doctor may intubate you if you need emergency surgery that calls for general anesthesia. In this case, it's likely that you haven’t fasted to empty your [stomach](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/abdominal-pain-causes-treatments) as you would for a planned procedure. Food from your stomach could get into your lungs (aspiration) if you vomit, or if it flows backward from your [stomach](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/cm/rm-quiz-surprising-stomach-facts). To keep this from happening, the tube has an air bladder that balloons up to seal off your airway from your stomach.

## What to Expect

Except in rare cases, your doctor will give you drugs to partly or completely knock you out before they put the tube in. They also typically give you a drug to paralyze your airway. This is so your body doesn’t fight against the insertion by gagging or other reflexes.

You might get plain oxygen from a mask for 2 or 3 minutes before the procedure starts to raise the level in your blood. You’ll lie faceup, and your doctor will tilt your head slightly back. They'll insert a scope with a light on it into your [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems). This lights up the airway. They'll look through the scope, or at a video screen if there is a camera attached.

The doctor will then thread the tube between your vocal cords and down into your windpipe. That's the part of your airway that connects to your lungs. Once the tube is at the right spot, your doctor blows up the cuff on the tube. This seals off much of your airway from your stomach and keeps food from getting into your lungs. But air can still flow through the tube.

Unless there are problems, the process shouldn’t take more than 5 minutes. Your doctor may still need to check how the tube's placed. They'll listen to your breathing with a stethoscope, check your CO2 levels, or take a chest X-ray.

## Complications

It's rare for intubation to cause problems, but it can happen. The scope can damage your [teeth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/teeth-and-gum-care) or cut the inside of your [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/cm/rm-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-your-teeth). The tube may hurt your throat and voice box, so you could have a [sore throat](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ss/slideshow-anatomy-of-a-sore-throat) or find it hard to talk and breathe for a time. The procedure may hurt your lungs or cause one of them to collapse. You might also get an infection or [pneumonia](https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-pneumonia-basics).

Certain things can make these problems more likely. If you've just eaten, there's a risk that the food can be pulled into your lungs. There's a greater chance that the scope will damage your [teeth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/cm/rm-quiz-teeth-truth) if they're in poor shape. If you smoke, have a [lung disease](https://www.webmd.com/lung/lung-diseases-overview) such as [COPD](https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/10-faqs-about-living-with-copd), have a neck or [spine](https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/cm/rm-quiz-spine-quiz) injury, or you're [overweight](https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/features/am-i-obese), it can make intubation and recovery harder.

## What to Know About Pneumonia Complications

When you get pneumonia -- whether it comes from bacteria, a virus, or a [fungus](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/fungal-infections-skin) \-\- there's a chance it could lead to other medical troubles. Learn the signs of complications of pneumonia and how to treat them.

**Is pneumonia deadly?**

Pneumonia can be deadly if it causes complications such as:

- Respiratory failure
- Sepsis
- Bacteremia, where bacteria enter the blood
- Lung abscesses, which are pus-filled spaces in the lung
- Kidney failure
- Lung failure
- Heart rhythm problems

However, this isn't the case for most people, especially if they get treatment early enough. You’re more likely to have a deadly pneumonia if you:

- Are under age 2 or over 65
- Have other serious conditions such as heart or kidney disease
- Have a weakened immune system
- Need artificial respiration
- Got pneumonia while in a hospital
- Were taking antibiotics in the months leading up to your case of pneumonia

## Bacteremia and Septic Shock

**What is bacteremia?**

Bacteremia is when bacteria are in your blood. It may happen in daily activities such as brushing and flossing your teeth, after dental and medical procedures, and with an infection such as a urinary tract infection. It usually doesn’t cause symptoms, and the immune system removes the bacteria in healthy people.

However, if your immune system doesn’t work as it should to remove the bacteria from the blood and if the bacteria increase, bacteremia can lead to an infection in the blood. Left untreated, it can progress to other more serious and life-threatening conditions such as sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

**Bacteremia and pneumonia**

If bacteria caused your pneumonia, they could get into your blood, especially if you didn't see a doctor for treatment.

**Bacteremia risk factors**

Bacteremia can happen to anyone but often occurs in children with common bacterial infections such as strep throat.

Older people with more than one health condition at a time, especially those who stay in community centers or are being treated in a hospital, are also at risk.

**Bacteremia symptoms**

People with bacteremia usually show no symptoms, or they have a mild fever. But if bacteremia progresses to a more serious condition such as sepsis or septic shock, your symptoms may include:

- Chills
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Fast heart rate
- Low blood pressure
- Stomach pain
- Diarrhea
- Rapid breathing
- Fever

Get immediate medical help if you show these symptoms.

**Bacteremia treatment**

Bacteremia is treated with antibiotics when it causes an infection or sepsis. Doctors may also remove any sources of bacteria, such as a catheter put in the body during treatment.

**Septic shock and pneumonia**

Bacteremia from pneumonia can lead to a serious situation known as [septic shock](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/sepsis-septicemia-blood-infection). It's a reaction to the infection in your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cm/rm-quiz-blood-basics), which can cause your blood pressure to drop lower than normal.

When your blood pressure is too low, your [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/high-cholesterol-healthy-heart) may not be able to pump enough blood to your organs, and they can stop working. Get medical help right away if you notice symptoms such as:

- [Fever](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/fevers-causes-symptoms-treatments)
- Fast heart rate
- Fast [breathing](https://www.webmd.com/lung/how-we-breathe)
- Chills that make you shiver
- [Low blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/heart/understanding-low-blood-pressure-basics)
- [Stomach](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/abdominal-pain-causes-treatments) upset ( [nausea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-nausea-vomiting), [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm), [vomiting](https://www.webmd.com/children/ss/nausea-vomiting-remedies-treatment), or [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea))
- Confusion

Your doctor will test your blood for bacteria and treat you with [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cm/rm-quiz-antibiotics-myths-facts) if you have bacteremia. You may get treated in the hospital for bacteremia or [septic shock](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ss/slideshow-sepsis-101).

## Lung Pneumonia Complications

Pneumonia can lead to complications that involve the lungs, including lung abscesses, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure.

**What are lung abscesses?**

Lung abscesses are pockets of pus in your [lungs](https://www.webmd.com/lung/healthy-lungs-smokers-lungs). It's more likely to happen if you:

- Had [gum disease](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/gingivitis-periodontal-disease) in the past
- Have bacteremia
- Have a weakened [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/10-immune-system-busters-boosters) \-\- your body's defense against germs
- Misuse [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/cm/rm-quiz-alcohol-myths-facts)

Men and older people are more likely to get [lung](https://www.webmd.com/lung/cm/rm-quiz-lungs-quiz) abscesses. Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms:

- A fever of 101 F or higher
- [Coughing](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/coughs) up pus
- Night sweats
- Not feeling hungry
- [Losing weight](https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm) without trying
- [Fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/women/why-so-tired-10-causes-fatigue)

Your doctor can test your [mucus](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/postnasal-drip) or the pus in your lungs to look for infection. They may also take an X-ray or a CT scan of your lungs.

Your doctor will likely treat your lung abscesses with antibiotics. They may do a procedure that uses a needle to remove the pus.

**Pleural effusion and pneumonia**

There are two layers of tissue surrounding your lungs called the pleura. One wraps around the outside of your lungs and the other lines the part of your chest where your lungs sit. They help your lungs move smoothly when you breathe.

If your pneumonia isn't treated, the pleura can get swollen, creating a sharp pain when you breathe in. If you don't treat the swelling, the area between the pleura may fill with fluid, which is called a [pleural effusion](https://www.webmd.com/lung/pleural-effusion-symptoms-causes-treatments).

You may not have any symptoms when you have pleural effusion. If you do, your symptoms may include:

- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Cough
- Fever
- Chills
- Hiccups
- Rapid breathing

You’re more likely to show symptoms as the fluid buildup increases.

**Empyema and pneumonia**

If the fluid from pleural effusion gets infected, it leads to a problem called empyema. Tell your doctor if you're having any of these symptoms:

[Chest pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/whats-causing-my-chest-pain) that gets worse when you breathe, [cough](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cm/rm-quiz-nighttime-cough), or [sneeze](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/know-your-allergy-triggers)

- Pain that travels to your back or [shoulder](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/why-does-my-shoulder-hurt)
- Fever
- Difficulty breathing
- You don't want to breathe deeply because it hurts

Your doctor may look for swelling or fluid with an X-ray, [ultrasound](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-an-ultrasound), or CT scan. They might also give you an EKG to ensure that a [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/cm/rm-quiz-know-heart) problem isn't the cause of your chest pain.

**What is pleurisy?**

Pleurisy is when the pleura or tissue around your lungs becomes inflamed. It can cause you to have sharp chest pains.

A doctor will likely treat pleural effusions, empyema, and pleurisy by treating the pneumonia. They may prescribe antibiotics.

If you have [pleurisy](https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-pleurisy-basics), you may need medications that can stop the swelling.

For pleural effusions and empyema, your doctor may also suggest a procedure that removes fluid from your body with a needle.

**Respiratory failure and pneumonia**

When you have pneumonia, your lungs can fill up with fluid. If that happens, they won't be able to transfer enough oxygen to your blood or get rid of the carbon dioxide in your blood. It's a serious condition because your organs need oxygen to work.

If your pneumonia is severe or you're in the hospital to treat it, your care team will watch you for signs of this rare -- but life-threatening -- complication.

You're more likely to get respiratory failure if you're hospitalized, have a weak [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-strengthen-immunity), have a history of [alcoholism](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/understanding-alcohol-abuse-basics), or if you're elderly.

Get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms:

- Fast breathing or not being able to breathe fully
- Feel like you cannot get enough air
- Racing or irregular heart rate
- Confusion
- A bluish tint to your [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin), fingertips, or lips
- Extreme restlessness
- [Anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/default.htm)
- [Fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/ss/slideshow-fatigue-causes-and-remedies)
- [Sweating](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hyperhidrosis2)
- Losing consciousness

To figure out if you're in respiratory failure, your doctor may use tools such as X-rays, CT scans, blood tests, and pulse oximeters. The best way to treat it is to get more oxygen, either through a tube in your nose or a mask that your doctor places over your [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems) and nose. You may also get medications to treat any infection that is causing the problem.

## Kidney Pneumonia Complications

Pneumonia can also lead to problems that affect how well your kidneys work, like acute kidney injury and, eventually, kidney failure.

**Kidney failure and pneumonia**

If you have bacteremia or septic shock, your heart may not be able to pump enough blood to your [kidneys](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information). It's not a common complication of pneumonia, but it's serious because your kidneys will stop working if they're not getting enough blood.

Your odds of getting kidney failure are higher if you're in the hospital or have other medical conditions on top of your pneumonia.

**Kidney failure symptoms**

As your kidneys stop working as well as they should, you may start having symptoms such as:

- Itchiness
- Swelling in the legs, [feet](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/foot-pain-causes-and-treatments), or [ankles](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/ankle-injuries-causes-and-treatments)
- Headaches
- Tiredness
- Sleep problems
- Loss of sense of taste
- Nausea and vomiting
- Not feeling hungry
- Unintentionally losing weight
- Not peeing enough or at all
- Muscle cramps, weakness, or numbness
- Joint pain or stiffness
- Memory problems
- Confusion
- Difficulty focusing

Get medical help immediately if have these symptoms.

**Kidney failure treatment**

Your doctor can see if your kidneys are working by looking at how much you're peeing and testing your [urine](https://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/cm/rm-quiz-urine-normal) or blood. Your doctor will treat the cause of your kidney failure, and in extreme cases, you may need to have your blood cleaned through a [dialysis](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/kidney-dialysis) machine until your kidneys are working again.

Your doctor may also recommend a kidney transplant to restore kidney function.

## Heart Pneumonia Complications

Pneumonia can cause complications that involve the heart, especially in older adults, including heart attack, irregular heartbeat, and heart failure, all of which may lead to death.

**Heart failure and pneumonia**

Research shows that 30% of people admitted to a hospital for pneumonia later on develop heart-related complications such as heart failure within 10 years of being discharged.

Some possible reasons for heart problems include bacteria that enter the heart, the [stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/default.htm) of the illness increasing the chance of having a heart problem, or your body not sending enough oxygen to your organs. The chances of having a heart problem related to your pneumonia are higher if you are elderly, are in the hospital, or already have a heart condition.

**Heart failure symptoms**

You may not have any symptoms as heart failure begins. When symptoms start, they can include:

- Shortness of breath or [trouble breathing](https://www.webmd.com/lung/breathing-problems-causes-tests-treatments)
- Continuous coughing and [wheezing](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/understanding-wheezing-treatment)
- Coughing up [mucus](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cm/rm-quiz-mucus) that is pink from blood
- Swelling in your feet, ankles, legs, fingers, or [stomach](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/cm/rm-quiz-surprising-stomach-facts)
- Not feeling hungry
- [Sudden weight gain](https://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-weight-gain-shockers) or loss
- [Fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/women/cm/rm-quiz-fatigue-something-else)
- Nausea
- Racing or abnormal heart rate
- Confusion

See a doctor immediately if you have at least two symptoms, whether you have heart problems or pneumonia.

**Heart failure treatment**

Your doctor can look for [heart failure](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/default.htm) by listening to your heart, testing your blood, or checking the results of an X-ray, EKG, echocardiogram, CT scan, or MRI.

Although heart failure has no cure, many medications, procedures, and heart-healthy lifestyle changes can help manage it.

Depending on whether your heart failure is left-sided or right-sided, your doctor may prescribe medications such as:

- Medicines that remove excess sodium and fluid from your body, such as diuretics
- Medicines that relax blood vessels so that your heart can more easily pump blood, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
- Medicines that lower your heart rate so your heart can pump blood better and stop heart failure from worsening, such as beta-blockers
- A medicine called digoxin that helps your heart pump more blood. A doctor will only prescribe it in cases of serious heart failure that other medicines can’t manage.

In some serious cases, you may need surgery that implants a medical device such as a pacemaker or mechanical heart pump to help your heart work better.

A heart transplant may be best for you if you have life-threatening heart failure that other treatments can't manage.

Lifestyle changes that may help manage heart failure include:

- Reduce how much salt you take to reduce fluid buildup, which can affect your heart health.
- Stay physically active and ask your doctor how much activity you should include in your day.
- Try to sleep regularly and well. See a doctor if you can’t sleep better despite practicing sleep hygiene, such as sleeping in a cool, dark, quiet room.
- Quit smoking. You can call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848) or visit the [CDC’s recommended resource](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/quit-smoking/index.html) for quitting.
- Avoid or limit how much alcohol you take.
- Manage any heart conditions that may worsen heart failure, such as blood pressure and heart rhythm problems.
- Manage your stress levels with relaxation exercises such as deep breathing and journaling. See a therapist or other mental health professional if you need help managing your stress levels.

## Takeaways

Pneumonia may lead to serious complications that may be life-threatening or affect how well you can function. You may be more at risk for these complications if you’re an older adult, have a weakened immune system, or have underlying health problems such as heart or kidney disease. See a doctor as soon as you can if you have serious symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling of the legs and hands, and unintentional weight loss or gain.

Written by [Shawna Seed](https://www.webmd.com/bio/shawna-seed)

3 min read

[Schizophrenia](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/mental-health-schizophrenia), a rare but serious [mental illness](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/default.htm), impairs the way you think, make decisions,  handle emotions, and interact with reality.

There’s no single cause of the condition -- it’s a complicated disease that involves many factors. Genetics play a part. Viruses or poor [nutrition](https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm) before birth might as well. Issues with key [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-diseases) chemicals can make you more likely to get the disease. Scientists also are continuing to study the role of drug use -- including marijuana -- in schizophrenia.

## An Established Link

One analysis of several studies found that marijuana, also called cannabis, is one of the most commonly abused substances among people with [schizophrenia](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/ss/slideshow-schizophrenia-overview). Young people with the condition, in particular, may abuse it more often than [alcohol](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/cm/rm-quiz-alcohol-myths-facts).

Researchers have puzzled over what that link means. Some say that people with schizophrenia may be more likely to use the drug because they’re looking for ways to ease their symptoms. But it’s unlikely that self-medication alone can explain the relationship between marijuana use and schizophrenia.

## Pot and Psychosis

One thing that marijuana and schizophrenia have in common is [psychosis](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/what-is-psychosis). It isn’t a mental illness -- rather, it’s a symptom. When you have psychosis, your thoughts are disrupted in a way that makes it hard for you to tell what’s real and what’s not. You might see or hear things that aren’t there, or you might have strange thoughts that won’t go away. Psychosis is a symptom of schizophrenia.

Studies have found that when you’re high on marijuana, you can have psychotic symptoms. The effect goes away as the high wears off.

Scientists think the main ingredient in marijuana that causes psychotic symptoms is THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol).

## The Schizophrenia Connection

The link between marijuana and psychosis goes beyond a short-lived high. If you already have schizophrenia and use the drug, your symptoms may get worse. You may have more psychotic episodes and spend more time in the hospital.

Researchers also have found that if you carry certain types of specific genes that affect [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/cm/rm-quiz-amazing-brain) chemistry, marijuana use can raise the chance you’ll have schizophrenia. One of those genes is called AKT1. Another is called COMT.

Cannabis may cause [schizophrenia symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-symptoms) to start earlier in life, too. Typically, men show signs of the disorder in their late [teens](https://teens.webmd.com/default.htm) to early 20s, and women in their late 20s to early 30s. Using marijuana may make symptoms show up as much as 3 years earlier.

The age at which you start using marijuana also might make a difference. Earlier use, especially during the teen years, may mean a greater chance of having schizophrenia, perhaps because your [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/video/brain-training) is still developing during this time.

If you have a parent or sibling with schizophrenia, you already have a higher chance of getting the disease. Using cannabis can make your odds even worse, taking them from one in 10 to one in five.

## A Therapeutic Effect?

Although the marijuana ingredient THC is thought to trigger psychosis, another component, cannabidiol (CBD), seems to fight it.

In one study, people with schizophrenia who were treated with CBD saw their symptoms improve and had fewer side effects than those who took traditional antipsychotic [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx).

It’s important to note, though, that these people were treated with a medical product in a supervised, clinical setting. That’s not the same thing as [smoking](https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/default.htm) weed on your own at home.

## What’s the Best Advice?

Although the exact nature of the marijuana-schizophrenia link is still murky, doctors know enough to offer some guidelines:

- It’s wise for teens to avoid marijuana or delay using it until they are adults.
- If you have schizophrenia, don’t use marijuana.
- If you have a family history of schizophrenia or other psychotic illness, avoid marijuana.
- If you are a caregiver for someone who has schizophrenia and uses marijuana, encourage them to quit.

If a wool sweater makes you [itch](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-pruritus), or if polyester pants give you a rash, you may have what’s called textile or clothing [dermatitis](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-common-adult-skin-problems). It’s a form of contact dermatitis. Your skin is reacting to the fibers in your clothes, or to the dyes, resins, and other chemicals used to treat what you wear.

## What Causes It?

Since clothing is in close contact with your [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin) most of the day, it’s no surprise that your shirts, pants, and undies can [cause skin problems](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/skin-problems-treatments-overview-facts).

Any kind of fiber can bring on a rash, but you’re more likely to get textile dermatitis from clothes made with synthetics such as polyester, rayon, nylon, spandex, or rubber. They don’t breathe as well as natural fibers, and they make you sweat more.

Often the source is the dye or other chemicals in the clothing. Formaldehyde resins used to make garments wrinkle-free or dirt-repellent can cause problems. So can dyes, glues, and chemicals used to tan, or create, leather. If you’re allergic to nickel, you might get a red, itchy reaction where your blue jeans button touches your skin. It has its own name: nickel [dermatitis](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/contact-dermatitis). Jewelry with nickel can cause it, too.

The combination of tight-fitting fabric and sweat can irritate your skin as it rubs against you. Doctors call this less common condition irritant dermatitis. It may look a lot like textile dermatitis, but the cause is different.

## What Are the Symptoms?

Look for redness, scaly skin, or itchy areas. Sometimes they pop up within hours after you put on your clothes, or they may take days or weeks to appear. Some people can wear the same item for years before a [rash](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/common-rashes) breaks out.

Symptoms often begin in the folds of your skin or other areas that make contact with your clothes and what’s in them. That includes:

- The crooks of your arms
- Behind your knees
- Armpits
- The groin
- Any place where your clothing is tight

## Who Gets It?

Women are more likely to have it because they more often wear tight-fitting clothes. So are [obese](https://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/features/am-i-obese) people when they overheat and sweat. People with atopic dermatitis, a skin disease that affects mostly children, are also more likely to get textile dermatitis.

Where you work also matters. People with jobs in hot and humid places, like a bakery, have greater odds of dermatitis. If you wear latex gloves on the job, your hands may get irritated (which would be irritant dermatitis) or you may become allergic to the latex itself. That’s allergic contact dermatitis.

## How Can I Prevent It?

The first thing is to stop wearing the item that bothers you. Your skin will most likely clear up within a few weeks. You can also:

- Wear natural fibers and loose clothes to help cut how much you sweat.
- Choose light-colored garments with less dye in them.
- Avoid items labeled “wash separately.” They’re more likely to bleed dye.
- Don’t wear clothes that say wash and wear, permanent press, no-iron, or dirt repellent. They’re likely to have chemicals that irritate your skin.

## How Do I Know What Causes My Rash?

It isn’t easy to figure out if your [skin problem](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/default.htm) is caused by irritation or an [allergy](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/default.htm), if it’s your clothes or the chemicals on them. Some clothes are made from a mix of fibers. They may be treated with several kinds of dyes and chemicals. But in general, the rashes and redness look alike and are hard for most people to tell apart. The location of the rash can be a clue to what’s causing it. If it’s on your waist, you could be allergic to the latex in your underwear elastic.

Your doctor may use a special skin patch to test these sources and find out which ones bother your skin.

## When Should I See My Doctor?

If your skin doesn’t clear up in a few weeks, or if the problems come and go, it’s time to talk to your skin doctor. Also check with the doctor if the rash covers a large area, is really painful, raw or intensely itchy, or seems to be spreading instead of getting better. They can make sure you don’t have an infection on top of the dermatitis.

## How Is It Treated?

If you know what clothing causes your rash and you stop wearing it, the rash usually goes away by itself and you don’t need [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx).

But if you’re miserable, the doctor may treat you with [antihistamines](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/antihistamines-for-allergies), moisture creams, or [steroids](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ss/slideshow-steroids-101) to give you some relief while your rash goes away. Try an [oatmeal bath](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/colloidal-oatmeal-baths) to soothe your skin. More severe cases of dermatitis may be treated with oral steroids like [prednisone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-9383-PREDNISONE+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=6007&drugname=prednisone+oral) and wet dressings.

Perhaps the shaking began recently. Or maybe it’s growing worse. It probably started gradually. It may have happened when you were stressed or angry. Or illness could have brought it on.

Whatever the cause, “tremor” is the name experts give to those shaky hands (and sometimes voice, head, mouth, and feet). They’re more common than you might think, and the causes and outcomes can be quite varied.

## Essential Tremor

Essential Tremor is the most common tremor disorder. It usually starts in your hands, but it can move to your arms, head, voice, or other body parts.

ET is different because it affects your hands when they’re already moving. Most other forms of tremor take place when you’re still.

It could result from a gene (your doctor may call this a mutation). That means if one of your parents has a tremor, you’re more likely to get one, too.

Toxins in the environment cause some cases. But more research is needed to better understand the connections.

Age is another risk factor. Although Essential Tremor can happen at any age, it’s more likely in people over 40. Your odds go up as you get older.

ET isn’t life-threatening, but it can get more severe over time. [Stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/default.htm), [fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/women/why-so-tired-10-causes-fatigue), and too much [caffeine](https://www.webmd.com/diet/caffeine-myths-and-facts) can worsen it. At some point, eating, drinking, writing, and all the other daily tasks you do with your hands can become a bigger challenge.

This condition can be hard to treat. There are medications, but none works consistently. Surgery is an option, as is a treatment called deep brain stimulation, in which doctors implant a device in your brain to help control the tremors. If shaky hands are a problem for you, ask your doctor if this might help. Learn more about [deep brain stimulation to treat essential tremor](https://www.webmd.com/brain/essential-tremor-brain-stimulation).

## Parkinson’s Disease

Tremor is an early sign of Parkinson’s disease, which affects 10 million people worldwide, 60,000 of them in the U.S.. Not everyone who has this disease gets shaky, but most people in the early stages will have slight movement in a hand, foot, or even a single finger

Most of the time, the tremor affects only one side of your body. Most often, it happens when you relax your muscles. That’s why it’s called a resting tremor.

When you move, the shaking stops. Even a little flex of your fingers can help. As with other types of tremors, stress or excitement can make it worse.

As you live with the disease, the tremor may spread from one side of your body to the other. Learn more about [Parkinson's tremors](https://www.webmd.com/consumer_assets/editorial/articles/health_and_medical_reference/brain_and_nervous_system/parkinsons_disease/symptoms/parkinsons_tremors).

## Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

This disease, which targets your immune system, brain, nerves, and spinal cord, can also make your hands shake. You’re most likely to have a tremor in your hand or foot. [MS](https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/default.htm) can cause a variety of tremors. The most common, like Essential Tremor, happens when you’re already moving. Learn more about [tremors with multiple sclerosis](https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/managing-related-tremors).

## Alcohol Withdrawal

Tremor is one of the first signs. If you weren’t too hooked, the shakes may last just a few days. If you drink a lot of alcohol, or for a long time, they can go on for a year or even longer. Learn more about [alcohol withdrawal symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms-treatments).

## It Isn’t Always a Disease

Shaky hands don’t always mean you’re ill. Sometimes a tremor is your body’s response to something:

[**Drugs**](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx): The most common culprits are medications that block a brain chemical called dopamine. It moves information from one part of your brain to another. These drugs are used to keep your mood even. The tremors will go away when you stop taking the drugs.

**B12 deficiency:** Without it, your nervous system won’t work like it should. You can find it in meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and milk products. If you’re getting so little that your hands shake, your doctor will give you a shot.

**Caffeine:** A cup of coffee or tea may cause your hands to shake.

**Stress:** From financial and job worries to relationship problems and health concerns, stress worsens tremors. Intense anger, extreme hunger, or [sleep deprivation](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-requirements) can all make your hands shake. This is known as physiologic tremor.

**Low blood sugar:** Your doctor will call this [hypoglycemia](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-hypoglycemia). It triggers your body’s natural stress response and makes you shaky.

**An** [**overactive thyroid**](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/overactive-thyroid-hyperthyroidism) **:** This gland is in your neck, just above your collarbone. When it’s in overdrive, your whole body speeds up. You may have [trouble sleeping](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm), your heart may beat faster, and your hands might shake.

[**Nerve damage**](https://www.webmd.com/brain/nerve-pain-and-nerve-damage-symptoms-and-causes) **:** Injury, disease, or a problem with your central nervous system can also cause tremors. Your doctor will call this [peripheral neuropathy](https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-peripheral-neuropathy-basics). It can affect your hands and feet.

Because the causes and treatments vary widely for different types of tremors, it’s important to talk with your doctor about your history and symptoms.

## What Is a Menstrual Cup?

A [menstrual cup](https://www.webmd.com/women/menstrual-cup) is a small, flexible cup that you insert into your vagina. Unlike a tampon or pad (which absorb your [period](https://www.webmd.com/women/5-things-about-your-period) flow), the cup catches and collects your flow. After a few hours, you remove the cup and wash it for reuse. It's also known as a period cup.

## Types of Menstrual Cups

Menstrual cups come in different sizes and materials.One key difference among cups is that they can be:

- Stemmed, with a bottom part that protrudes into your vagina to make removing the cup easier
- Unstemmed, which some people prefer since the stems can be irritating and might need to be trimmed for comfort

You'll see them mostly sold in small and large sizes.

- Small: For people with a light to medium flow, who are under 30, or who haven't had a [baby](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/forming-a-bond-with-your-baby-why-it-isnt-always-immediate).
- Large: For people with a heavy flow, over age 30, or who have had a baby.
- Some companies also offer a "teen" size that is smaller than the small size, and/or an extra-large size.

Most period cups are made of silicone. However, some are made of rubber, so if you're allergic to latex, buy one that's made of silicone.

Menstrual cups also come in different shapes:

- V shape: The cup is longer than it is wide, tapering gradually from the rim. This is the most popular design.
- Bell shape: The cup is rounder than the V-shape, flaring out from the rim. It is longer than it is wide.
- Round: The cup is wider than it is long, with the widest point of the vessel being below the rim.
- Asymmetrical: The cup has a slanted edge to sit at a certain rotation and angle under the [cervix](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/cervical-cancer). It is longer than it is wide.

Like any other product for your period, you can buy cups online or over the counter at grocery stores and drugstores.

## When Were Menstrual Cups Invented?

Although they may seem like a recent invention, menstrual cups have been around since the 1800s. The first menstrual cup, patented in 1867, was basically a rubber sack attached to a rubber ring.

In 1937, an American actor named Leona Chalmers patented the first commercially available menstrual cup, designing something that would fit in with her on-the-move lifestyle. Her design was very similar to some of the bell-shaped menstrual cups we have today. However, manufacturing it was hard, as it was made of rubber, a scarce material during World War II.

In the 1960s, Chalmers tried again, partnering with a bigger menstrual products company to produce the cup. But women found it too rigid and embarrassing to insert, so it was not a success. In the early 2000s, menstrual cups were reintroduced, this time in a softer silicone form, which helped them find a bigger consumer market.

## How to Use a Menstrual Cup

If you're new at this, or trying it just before your period begins, you might want to start with the small size. Read the instructions that come with your cup. If you're taking the cup out of its packaging, wash it with soap and water and dry it before using it for the first time.

**How to insert a menstrual cup**

- Wash your hands well with soap and water.
- Apply a thin layer of a water-based lubricant to the rim of the cup or just wet it. This will make it easier to put in. So, some people prefer to insert the cup in the shower.
- Tightly fold the menstrual cup (using one of the methods below), keeping the rim side up.
-  Insert it inside your [vagina](https://www.webmd.com/teens/your-vagina-15-things-every-owner-should-know), just like you would a tampon without an applicator. You might find it easier to insert the cup squatting, sitting on the toilet, or with one leg up. Slide the folded cup in toward your tailbone at roughly a 45-degree angle.
- Once inside, your cup should spring open and rest against the walls of your vagina. It forms a seal to prevent leaks. The blood then simply drips into the cup.
- If the cup doesn't open or feels uncomfortable, try to rotate it a little. Used correctly, you shouldn’t feel it.

**Menstrual cup folds**

Some people find it helpful to experiment with different ways of folding the cup for insertion. For example, you might try:

**The C fold.** Flatten the cup and then fold it in half, so the rim looks like a C. You might find the cup pops into place most easily from this position.

**The 7 fold.** Bend one corner of the rim to form the shape of the number 7, creating a narrower entry point.

**The punch-down fold.** Use your index finger to hold down one side of the cup. This also creates a smaller entry point and lets you keep the fold in place as you guide the cup inside.

It may take a bit of practice to get the cup to fit comfortably, but it can't get lost inside your vagina.

**How to remove a menstrual cup**

- Wash your hands clean with soap and water.
- Sit (or squat) in a comfortable position.
- Insert your index finger and thumb into your vagina and locate the cup's stem or bottom. Don't pull the stem. Just above it, you'll feel the cup base. Gently pinch it to break the seal and remove it. If it's not coming out, use your pelvic floor muscles to push the cup down, then reach up and grab the stem and pinch the base.
- Keep the cup upright to avoid spills. Once it's out, empty the contents into the toilet.
- Unless your cup is disposable, wash it out with soap and water.

Note: Although you can keep your period cup inserted for up to 12 hours, you may need to change it more often if you're having a heavy period day.

## Benefits of Menstrual Cups

**They're budget-friendly.** A reusable cup costs more upfront but often costs less over time than tampons and pads.

**They're eco-friendly.** Unless you use disposable brands, you can use the same cup for a long time, an average of 2-10 years, meaning less waste in landfills.

**You can leave them in for up to 12 hours.** Tampons may need to be changed every four to eight hours, depending on your flow. But cups can stay in longer, so they’re good for overnight protection. And once you get the hang of inserting one, there’s no need to wear a backup pad or liner.

**You don't have to wait until your period starts to put one in.** You can insert it into your vagina around the time you expect your period to start. This lessens the chance of a leak.

**They hold more.** A menstrual cup can hold 1 ounce of liquid, roughly twice the amount of a super-absorbent tampon or pad. That difference can be a comfort on your heavy flow days.

**They're easy to use.** Some people may have trouble with them at first, but if you've used tampons (particularly the kind without the applicator) or a vaginal ring or diaphragm for [birth control](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-pills), you'll probably find them easy to insert.

**There’s less odor.** Menstrual blood can start to smell when it’s exposed to air. But your cup forms an airtight seal.

**You don't have to worry about vaginal dryness.** Menstrual cups don't cause [vaginal dryness](https://www.webmd.com/women/vaginal-dryness-causes-moisturizing-treatments), unlike tampons.

## Disadvantages of Menstrual Cups

**It can be tough to find the right fit.** Cups come in different sizes depending on your age, flow, and whether you’ve had a child. Still, finding the perfect fit can be a challenge, more so if you have a tilted uterus or low cervix. It can take some trial and error to find the right fit, and you could have leaks in the meantime.

**Removal can get messy.** Even if you find it easy to insert the cup, removing it can be tricky and feel icky, particularly if you have to do it in a public restroom. One option is to bring a bottle of water into the stall to rinse the cup, then wipe it clean with toilet paper. If that's not possible, simply wipe the cup with toilet paper, making sure that the tiny holes at the top of the cup are clear, since those create the suction seal. You can do a proper wash when you get home.

**They could interfere with an [IUD](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/iud-intrauterine-device).** Some manufacturers don’t recommend using a menstrual cup if you have an [intrauterine device](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/iud-intrauterine-device) [(IUD)](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/iud-intrauterine-device) in place, as there’s a chance suction from the cup could pull on the string or dislodge it. A 2012 study found no evidence of this. Still, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor before combining the two.

**They can be hard to insert or remove.** This can happen if you're a new user, especially if you've never used a tampon or had sex. But you can learn to use them.

**They could irritate your vagina.** That's most likely if they are put in without lubricant or not properly cleaned.

**They need to be washed after every use**. Some people might find this a hassle, but it's the only way to avoid infection. The risk of toxic shock syndrome is very low for menstrual cup wearers. A 2019 review of clinical studies found only five cases of [toxic shock syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/women/understanding-toxic-shock-syndrome-basics) after the use of a menstrual cup. The need for washing also means you need access to clean water. That might be a problem if you're camping, hiking, or experiencing homelessness.

## How to Clean a Menstrual Cup

Each time you remove and empty the cup, rinse it with water and wash it with mild soap. Some manufacturers make special cleaning solutions for this purpose. Be sure to read the instructions that come with your cup to make sure you're cleaning it properly.

At the end of your cycle, sterilize your cup in boiling water and dry it for next month's use.

## How to Store a Menstrual Cup

Your cup may come with a breathable cloth bag or case. Use it or a similar container to keep your cup clean and dry between uses.

## How Much Do Menstrual Cups Cost?

On average, a reusable cup costs $20-$40 and lasts up to 10 years. That can make it quite a bit less expensive than tampons and pads, which can add up to as much as $150 a year.

One catch is that you might need to try more than one kind of cup to find the best one for you, making your costs higher. And, of course, you can't return this kind of personal care product to the store.

## Why Is My Menstrual Cup Leaking?

When inserted correctly, menstrual cups have a lower chance of leaking than tampons. But leaks can still happen because the cup may:

- Not open properly after insertion
- Be inserted at a wrong angle
- Be inserted too high in the vagina
- Overflow because of heavy [menstruation](https://www.webmd.com/women/normal-period)
- Be the wrong size

To reduce leaks, follow insertion instructions carefully, track how often to empty the cup on heavy flow days, and try different sizes or designs.

## Menstrual Cup vs. Disc

A menstrual disc is a different period product. It's shaped like a disc and inserted higher in the vagina, at the base of your cervix. Like a cup, it can collect your flow for up to 12 hours. Unlike a cup, it doesn't rely on suction to stay put. It's made of the same materials as a menstrual cup. Some types can be reused, while others are designed to be thrown away after one use.

Unlike some kinds of menstrual cups, you can wear a disc with an IUD without any worries. You can also use it while having sex, which is not a good idea with a cup. Also, one size fits most, so you don't usually have to keep shopping to find the right fit. Some brands do offer different sizes.

On the downside, people often find them harder to insert than a menstrual cup and messier to remove. Some brands have extra features, such as a double loop tab on the end to make removal easier.

You clean and take care of menstrual discs the same way you'd take care of cups.

## Takeaways

Menstrual cups can be cost-saving alternatives to tampons and pads. They also can cut down on waste. But, like other period products, they're not right for everyone. If you want to try one, choose the right size and then experiment with insertion techniques, to get the best fit and protection. And be sure to carefully follow cleaning instructions.

## Menstrual Cup FAQs

**Is a menstrual cup painful?**

Some users report some discomfort when first inserting a menstrual cup, but most people have no [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/understanding-pain-management-chronic-pain) once they learn how to use it. If you do have some pain when you insert it, it might be because you didn't lubricate the rim. If it hurts inside you, you might not have the best cup for you; for example, one that's too firm. And if the cup hurts when you remove it, it might be because you didn't break the suction first. To do that, you squeeze the base a bit before pulling it out. If you can't comfortably use a cup after some trial and error, or if you develop new discomfort after using one for a while, talk to your doctor.

**Which is better, a menstrual cup or a pad?**

It's usually a matter of preference. Some people, including those who prefer not to insert anything in their vaginas, are happy with pads. Others want to explore their options. Every period product — be it a pad, tampon, cup, disc, or period underwear — has pros and cons. And some people have health reasons that make certain methods unsuitable. For example, menstrual cups aren't recommended if you've just had a baby, a miscarriage, or an [abortion](https://www.webmd.com/women/abortion-procedures).

**Which is better, a menstrual disc or a cup?**

This also depends on your preferences, including whether you want to have sex while wearing period protection, which you can do with a disc but not a cup.

**Can we pee while using a menstrual cup?**

Yes, you can pee, because a menstrual cup doesn't block your urethra, the opening for your pee. It's the same as using a tampon.

**Do gynecologists recommend menstrual cups?**

Yes. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists includes menstrual cups on the list of period products that can work well.

**Can a virgin use a menstrual cup?**

Yes, you can use a menstrual cup if you've never had sex. Placing a menstrual cup or a tampon in your vagina is safe, starting with your first period. In some cases, it might stretch the [hymen](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-to-know-about-the-hymen), the thin tissue at the opening of the vagina. But that can also happen if you ride a bike, dance, or do gymnastics.

## What Is a Calorie Deficit?

Calories are a measure of the amount of energy in food. All of the cells in your body require energy in order to work properly, just like a car needs fuel. They get that energy from the foods that you eat. Your body breaks down that food during digestion, releasing the energy that it contains. Those food calories – now converted to energy – power everything that you do: breathing, thinking, walking, sleeping, digesting, you name it.

But your body may not need to use all that energy right after you eat. It stores those extra calories – mostly as fat but also as carbohydrates – for later use. When you go to the gym, study hard for a test, or find yourself involved in any other energy-demanding activity, those stores provide the energy you need to power through.

If your activities burn fewer calories than you consume, those stores of extra calories will grow, and you will gain weight.

But the opposite is also true: You will lose weight if you burn more calories than you consume. That’s because doing so creates a calorie deficit. It forces your body to burn through the stores of fat that you have built up. This leads to weight loss. In fact, you won’t lose weight without a calorie deficit.

## What Should Your Calorie Deficit Be?

A good rule of thumb for healthy weight loss is a deficit of about 500 calories per day. That should put you on course to lose about 1 pound per week. This is based on a starting point of at least 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day for women and those assigned female at birth, and 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day for men and those assigned male at birth. It can be unhealthy to take in less than that per day. Talk to your doctor about the minimum calories you need.

Keep in mind that you may not need a calorie deficit at all. You only need it if you want to lose weight for health or other reasons. Always talk to your doctor before you start a weight loss plan, especially if you have health problems.

## How to Reach a Calorie Deficit to Lose Weight

Reaching a calorie deficit sounds simple: Eat fewer calories than your body needs. But to do that, you must first find out what those needs amount to: How many calories do you burn each day? Once you have established that, you take that total number of calories and subtract from it the number of calories necessary to achieve the calorie deficit you desire.

An example: Let’s say you find that you need roughly 2,000 calories a day, and you want to lose about 1 pound per week. You could do this by eating about 500 fewer calories every day. Your goal, then, is to eat 1,500 calories daily. That creates a 500-calorie deficit.

There’s another way. Instead of eating fewer calories on a daily basis, you instead increase the amount of exercise you do so that you burn 500 more calories every day. The result: You need 2,500 calories daily, but you keep consuming 2,000 calories. You have created that same 500-calorie deficit.

You also can mix and match: Increase the amount of exercise you do daily to burn, say, 200 more calories while cutting 300 calories from your daily diet. Your calorie deficit: 500.

These basic examples simply explain how it’s done. The best way to create – and maintain – your calorie deficit is the way that works for you.

Keep in mind that your calorie needs depend on several things: your age, sex, height, weight, and exercise habits. This [calculator](https://reference.medscape.com/calculator/846/mifflin-st-jeor-equation) can help you figure out your daily calorie requirements.

Other things that determine your calorie needs:

**Your metabolic rate.** This is how quickly or slowly you burn calories at rest. It varies widely from person to person.

**Some health conditions.** Hypothyroidism, in which your thyroid gland is underactive, slows metabolism. So does Cushing’s syndrome, a condition that’s caused by having too much of the hormone cortisol.

Remember, creating too much of a calorie deficit is a bad idea. It can cause several side effects, including:

- Constipation
- Dehydration
- Fatigue
- Headaches
- Nausea

It may also leave you feeling "hangry": angry because you’re hungry.

Along with those side effects, an oversized calorie deficit will be harder for your body to adjust to and harder for you to maintain. You’ll likely be more successful over the long haul with a significant but sustainable calorie deficit.

## Diet Plan for a Calorie Deficit

There’s no single best approach to cutting calories. In general, as long as you cut the calories and maintain a minimum amount, you will lose weight.

One proven method is to replace all sugar-sweetened beverages with water, which has no calories. That means soda, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened waters and iced teas, and other high-calorie beverages. And don’t forget: Fruit juice contains abundant calories. A 6-ounce serving has 60 to 120 calories.

Water not only keeps you hydrated. It may help you adapt to a lower-calorie diet. And keep in mind: When you feel hungry, it may actually be a sign you're thirsty, so reach for a glass of water rather than a caloric snack.

The DASH and Mediterranean diets also show some success. These focus on eating:

- Fresh fruits and vegetables
- Lean proteins
- Whole grains
- Nuts
- Seeds

These types of foods help you feel full longer, so you may be less likely to snack between meals. Just be sure to count your calories. Smaller portions can help, too, along with careful planning of your meals.

A registered dietitian can help you figure out healthy ways to manage your portions and lower your daily calories.

Other tips for maintaining a calorie deficit:

**Curb your simple carbs.** White bread, white rice, regular pasta, and other low-fiber, high-carb foods won’t help you feel as full as high-fiber complex carbs like brown rice and other whole grains as well as whole fruits and vegetables.

**Go light at restaurants.** Avoid large portions and high-fat menu offerings. Start with a small salad or a light soup to fill you up, so you don’t overdo it. Have fresh fruit or sorbet for dessert.

**Read food labels.** Important info, like calorie counts and sugar content, can help guide your choices. Take time to compare. For example, some yogurts contain more sugar than others, even if they have less fat.

**Limit prepackaged meals.** These often contain more fat, sugar, and salt than you want. Cooking meals made from whole foods puts you in greater control.

**What are the best calorie-deficit breakfast options?**

For your first meal of the day, focus on fiber and animal or plant protein, which both promote fullness. That may help you avoid snacking throughout the day. Here are a few examples:

- Plain Greek yogurt, with added berries, nuts, or seeds
- A two- or three-egg or egg white omelet with mixed vegetables and quarter-cup of feta cheese or shredded low fat-cheese
- A smoothie heavy on the protein, with a half-cup of Greek yogurt or a scoop of protein powder, a cup of frozen fruit, a cup of leafy green veggies like spinach or kale, and low fat-milk or an unsweetened milk alternative

## Physical Activity for a Calorie Deficit

Research shows that diet changes alone raise your calorie deficit more easily than exercise alone. Still, you often get the best weight loss results if you combine diet changes with moderate to vigorous exercise.

Shoot for 30 minutes or more on most days of the week, though 45 minutes or more may be better for keeping the weight off. You don’t have to do it all at once. You can do shorter bouts throughout the day. Think 10-minute spurts.

For a brief moderate workout, take a walk around the block or do a bit of gardening or lawn mowing in the afternoon. Bike riding and swimming are also great options. More vigorous exercise includes running, heavy yard work, and aerobic dancing, like Zumba.

Strength training also can help with weight loss. Make a plan to lift weights at least twice a week. You can use dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, resistance bands, exercise machines, and even your own body weight (think pushups and planks).

Be sure to talk to your doctor before you start a new exercise program, particularly if you’re over 50, overweight, pregnant, or have other health conditions or are on certain medications, such as those that treat diabetes.

And remember: Regular exercise goes a long way in protecting your health even if you don’t lose weight. It stops your body from packing on the pounds. And if you have lost weight, it helps you maintain your weight loss.

## Other Ways to Reach a Calorie Deficit

Certain eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, can prevent you from achieving a calorie deficit to help with your efforts at healthy weight loss. Such disorders lead to or are caused by complex relations to food and eating, and treating them requires more than just addressing the way you eat. Different approaches work for different people. A therapist may be able to help you change thought patterns about food and exercise. Methods include:

- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Motivational interviewing
- Acceptance and commitment therapy

Smartphone apps can help you watch your food intake and remind you to exercise, among other things.

## Potential Calorie Deficit Risks

While a calorie deficit can help you achieve your weight loss goals, it can be harmful if you don’t do it in a healthy way. The risks include:

**Too little nutrition.** If you cut too many calories or if you don’t eat the right foods, your body won’t get all the nutrients it needs. For example, if you don’t eat enough calcium-rich food, you put your bone health at risk.

**Low energy.** As you cut calories, your body tries to conserve its energy stores by slowing your metabolism. This can make you feel cold and sluggish. It also can lead to constipation.

**Brain drain.** Just like the rest of your body, your brain needs calories for energy. Cutting too many calories may impact your brain function.

**Gallstones.** Severely restricting calories can lead to rapid weight loss, a risk factor for painful gallstones.

**Disordered eating.** Dieting can make you focus too much on food and bring other negative feelings, which may lead to problematic eating and, potentially, an eating disorder.

**Can you build muscle in a calorie deficit?**

Yes. But keep in mind that you build muscle with strength training exercises. Such workouts require energy, which means calories, so you may need to maintain only a small deficit. That will allow you to burn fat while still building muscle. Also, your calorie needs will be greater on the days you work out, so you’ll have to plan for that. Finally, make sure you don’t skimp on muscle-building protein when you cut calories. Instead, reduce the calories you get from carbs and fats.

## Takeaways

Maintaining a calorie deficit will lead to weight loss. But don’t go overboard. You will struggle to keep up with an oversized calorie deficit, and you will put your health at risk. Instead, aim for a reasonable deficit that allows you lose weight slowly but steadily.

## Calorie Deficit FAQs

**How do I calculate my calorie deficit?**

It’s based on things like your age, sex, activity level, and more. Try this calculator: https://reference.medscape.com/calculator/846/mifflin-st-jeor-equation

**Is 1,200 calories a day a deficit?**

Any amount of calories less than what your body needs daily to maintain your current weight is a deficit. So, if you normally eat 1,500 calories a day, for example, then 1,200 would be a deficit.

**What calorie deficit do I need to lose 2 pounds a week?**

You should eat about 1,000 fewer calories per day. That’s a safe amount of calorie restriction, but a smaller calorie restriction, such as 500 calories, may be easier to maintain over the long term.

**How many calories should I eat a day to lose weight?**

It depends on how many calories you eat every day to maintain your current weight. For example, if you normally eat 2,500 calories daily, then eating fewer calories will lead to weight loss. Reduce your calories to 2,000 per day, and you should lose about a pound each week.

## What Is a Neti Pot?

If you're one of the millions of people dealing with sinus problems, you know how uncomfortable facial pain and clogged nasal passages can be. In their search for relief, many have turned to nasal saline irrigation, a therapy that uses a saltwater solution to flush out the nasal passages.

Although several methods of nasal irrigation exist, one of the most popular is the neti pot. The neti pot is a ceramic or plastic pot that looks like a cross between a small teapot and Aladdin's magic lamp. Although nasal irrigation using a neti pot has been around for centuries, originally from the Ayurvedic/yoga tradition, its use is on the rise in the U.S.

**Where to find a neti pot**

Neti pots are available over the counter at many drugstores, health food stores, and online retailers. They usually cost between $10 and $30.

## Reasons to Use a Neti Pot

You can use a neti pot to manage symptoms of sinus infections (sinusitis), colds, the flu, COVID-19, and allergies involving the nose. You can also use it to push out mucus and allergens, prevent your nostrils from irritation, help you breathe more freely, moisturize your nostrils in dry indoor air, and relieve a stuffy or blocked nose.

**Wudu nasal rinsing**

The Islamic faith practices nasal rinsing in wudu or ablution, a ritual performed before prayers that happen five times a day.

Ritual nasal rinsing is also practiced in yogic, Ayurvedic, and other traditions.

## Neti Pot Benefits

Ear, nose, and throat surgeons may recommend nasal irrigation for patients who've had sinus surgery to clear away crusting in the nasal passages.

Many people with sinus symptoms due to allergies and irritants in the environment also use neti pots or other nasal irrigation devices, saying they ease congestion and help with facial pain and pressure.

Nasal irrigation can be an effective way to relieve sinus symptoms when used along with standard treatments. For some people, nasal irrigation relieves sinus symptoms without medications.

Some benefits you may get from using a neti pot include:

- A rinsed nasal passage
- Cleared mucus / crusting
- Reduced stuffy nose
- Improved breathing
- Relief from sinus pain and pressure

## How Does a Neti Pot Work?

At its most basic level, a neti pot thins mucus and helps flush it out of the nasal passages.

A more biological explanation has to do with tiny, hairlike structures called cilia that line the inside of your nasal and sinus cavities. These cilia wave back and forth to push mucus either to the back of the throat, where it can be swallowed, or to the nose to be blown out. Saline solution can help increase the speed of the cilia and improve their coordination. This allows them to better remove allergens and other irritants that cause sinus problems.

## Neti Pot Solution

You can buy premade solutions meant for use in the neti pot or other nasal irrigation devices. But you can also make a saline solution at home.

**Neti pot solution recipe**

Mix 3 teaspoons of iodide-free and preservative-free salt with 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Store in a small, clean container. When you're ready to use the neti pot, mix 1 teaspoon of this mixture into 8 ounces of distilled, sterile, or boiled and cooled water.

For children, use a half-teaspoon of salt with 4 ounces of water.

## How to Use a Neti Pot

Neti pots usually come with an insert that explains how to use them. Be sure to follow these directions carefully. You might want to ask your primary care doctor or an ear, nose, and throat specialist to talk you through the process before trying a neti pot on your own.

**Neti pot instructions**

1. Wash your hands before picking up the neti pot.
2. Fill the neti pot with the saline solution.
3. Lean over a sink and tilt your head over it at about a 45-degree angle so that the liquid doesn't flow into your mouth when you start.
4. Breathe through your mouth as you place the spout into your top nostril
5. Gently pour the solution into that top nostril.
6. The fluid will flow through your nasal cavity and out the other nostril. It may also run into your throat. If this happens, just spit it out.
7. Blow your nose to remove any remaining liquid, refill the neti pot, and repeat the process on the other side.
8. After each use, clean and rinse your neti pot or other irrigation device following the manufacturer's instructions, and leave it open to air-dry.

If you notice burning or stinging when you use the saline solution, reduce the amounts of dry ingredients to make it weaker.

**Best time of day to use a neti pot**

You can use a neti pot any time of the day, once or twice a day.

**How often can you use a neti pot?**

In studies, people with daily sinus symptoms got relief from using a neti pot or other nasal irrigation system daily. Three times a week was often enough once their symptoms eased.

But using it too often can irritate your nasal passages. And it might be counterproductive to use it daily for a long time.

The mucus in our nasal passages helps to protect us against infection. It captures germs and irritants before they enter our bodies and can even kill some bacteria. Some experts think that when you flush out mucus with nasal irrigation, you lose some of that protection.

That's why it might not be a good idea to use nasal irrigation as a preventive measure when you don't have any sinus symptoms. Some experts say you should use it for no more than 1-3 weeks at a time.

If your symptoms don't improve, see your doctor. They can figure out what's causing the problem and find the right treatment.

## Neti Pot Side Effects

Research has found that a neti pot, used as directed, is generally safe. A few regular users experience mild side effects that go away, such as:

- Nasal irritation
- Stinging
- Burning

You can also get nosebleeds, but they're rare.

If you experience these side effects, try to reduce the amount of salt in the solution, adjust the frequency of neti pot use, or change the temperature of the water to get relief.

**Congestion worse after sinus rinse**

Your congestion can feel worse after a sinus rinse if you use only water rather than the saline solution. It can cause swelling in the nasal passages, making symptoms worse.

**Neti pot water stuck in sinuses**

Water from the neti pot can get stuck in your sinuses if you don't tilt your head correctly. You can tilt your head properly, ensuring it's at a 45-degree angle, so the saline rinse doesn't get stuck or flow into your mouth.

If you feel like some of the solution is still in your nasal passages, tilt your head forward and to the opposite side of the nostril you just rinsed, and blow your nose gently.

If you experience side effects or develop an infection after using a neti pot or nasal irrigation device, talk to your doctor.

## Sinus Rinse Dangers

A potentially serious infection from nasal irrigation, like a Naegleria fowleri infection, is possible with a sinus rinse. _Naegleria fowleri_ is an amoeba that lives in pipes linked to tap water, ponds, lakes, and rivers. If you use water with this amoeba in your sinus rinse, it can go to your brain and cause primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).

PAM can destroy brain tissue and cause brain swelling and death. It's called a brain-eating amoeba for this reason. With a PAM infection, you may have symptoms like:

- Headache
- Fever
- Nausea
- Vomiting

As the condition progresses, symptoms may include:

- Seizures
- Stiff neck
- Changes in mental state
- Hallucinations
- Coma

However, _Naegleria fowleri_ infections are rare, with only 157 reported cases from 1962 to 2022.

To prevent a serious infection from happening during a sinus rinse, take these precautions:

**Never use unboiled tap water for nasal irrigation.** Some tap water contains bacteria or other harmful organisms. It's safe to drink since your stomach acid kills them. But they can live in your nasal passages. You can use distilled, sterile, or filtered water if you don't have boiled water.

**Take proper care of your device.** Nasal irrigation devices can harbor bacteria, too. Before you use it, wash your hands and make sure the device is clean and dry. After using it, always wash it thoroughly. You can wash it by hand or put it in the dishwasher if it's dishwasher-safe. Let your device air-dry entirely between uses. Replace your neti pot every few months or as recommended by its directions.

See a doctor if you have symptoms of an infection, like fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, or tiredness.

## How to Care for Your Neti Pot

Always clean and air dry your neti pot after using it to prevent it from harboring bacteria or other harmful organisms that can enter your nasal passages during your next use. Also, don't share your neti pot with anyone to prevent spreading germs.

Replace your neti pot every few months as directed by the manufacturer.

**How to clean neti pots**

Here's how to clean your neti pot:

- Wash your hands first before picking up the neti pot
- Add boiled, distilled, sterile, or filtered water mixed with dish soap to the neti pot
- Replace the lid with your finger and shake it
- Pour out the soapy water
- Rinse the neti pot with boiled, distilled, sterile, or filtered water
- Air-dry before closing it with the lid

You'll also find the manufacturer's cleaning instructions on the package with the neti pot. It's best to follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning it.

## Neti Pot Alternatives

Other nasal irrigation devices you can use to relieve your nasal passages include:

- Bulb syringes
- Squeeze bottles
- Battery-operated pulsed water devices
- Saline nasal sprays

## Takeaways

Neti pots are a popular nasal irrigation device that can help relieve stuffy or irritated nasal passages. It's generally safe to use and may only cause minor side effects like stinging and burning. However, only use boiled water left to cool, sterile, distilled, or filtered water for your nasal saline irrigation. Be sure to wash the neti pot after every use. Change it every few months, and don't share it with others.

## Neti Pot FAQs

**Where can I find a neti pot?**

You can find a neti pot over the counter at drugstores, health food stores, and online retailers.

**Are there any downsides to neti pots?**

Using neti pots when you don't need them can put you at risk of developing an infection. Other than that, using a neti pot and cleaning it appropriately may only come with mild side effects like stinging or burning.

**What's the difference between the neti pot and sinus rinse?**

Sinus rinse involves rinsing your nasal passages with a saline solution and a device like a neti pot. It can help clear out congestion, mucus, crust, and irritants from the nose and help you breathe more freely.

## What Is the Tetanus Vaccine?

The tetanus vaccine is part of the recommended series of childhood and adult immunizations. It protects against the bacterial infection tetanus, also known as lockjaw. Tetanus causes jaw cramping and painful [muscle spasms](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/muscle-spasms-cramps-charley-horse). There's no cure, and 10%-20% of people who have it die.

The tetanus vaccine has made tetanus a preventable disease. Thanks to its widespread use, lockjaw has become very rare in the U.S. Even so, you need to be vaccinated against it.

## Tetanus Vaccine Types

Four different kinds of vaccines protect against tetanus and other diseases. The one you get is based on your age and what vaccines you have already had.

For babies and young children:

- **DTaP** protects against [diphtheria](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/tdap-vaccine-for-adults), tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough).

For older children and adults:

- **Tdap** protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.
- **Td** is a booster shot for older children and adults and only protects against diphtheria and tetanus.

## Tetanus Vaccine Schedule

Children typically get five doses of the DTaP vaccine at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years. Then comes one dose of Tdap between the ages of 11 and 12 and a Td or Tdap booster every 10 years.

If you didn't get a tetanus vaccine as a child, you should start with a three-dose series. You'll get two shots at least 4 weeks apart and a third shot 6-12 months later. After that, you'll need a booster every 10 years.

Your might need an extra tetanus shot if you get a deep cut or wound. For instance, if you step on a rusty nail, your

**How long does a tetanus vaccine last?**

You need to get a tetanus booster every 10 years. Some studies have found it may protect you much longer, maybe even up to 30 years. But more research is needed to confirm that.

## How Does the Tetanus Vaccine Work?

The tetanus vaccine activates your immune system. Then, your immune system makes special proteins called antibodies, which fight bacteria. If the bacteria that cause tetanus, _Clostridium tetani_, find their way into your skin, the antibodies will identify and destroy them.

**Tetanus vaccine dose**

A typical tetanus vaccine dose contains 0.5 mL of tetanus toxoid.

## Who Should Get the Tetanus Vaccine?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that everyone should be vaccinated for tetanus. Babies and children should have their vaccines according to the recommended schedule. As an adult, you should have a tetanus shot if you:

- Did not get a series of tetanus shots as a child
- Have not had a tetanus booster in the last 10 years

Your doctor may also recommend having a tetanus shot if you have a deep cut or skin puncture.

## Tetanus Vaccine in Pregnancy

You'll need a tetanus shot during your third trimester of pregnancy. The best time to receive the shot is between 27 and 36 weeks. The vaccine is given each time you're pregnant to protect you and your baby from tetanus.

Your doctor will give you the Tdap vaccine. It also protects newborns against whooping cough, which has been on the rise. Research has shown fewer babies die from whooping cough when Tdap is given during pregnancy instead of waiting until after birth.

You can receive Tdap any time during your pregnancy if you develop a cut or if there's a whooping cough outbreak. Even if you get the shot when you first become pregnant, you should get another one during your third trimester.

## Who Should Not Get the Tetanus Vaccine?

The tetanus vaccine is safe for most people. You shouldn't get a Tdap vaccine if you have had a severe allergic reaction in the past to any vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Talk to your doctor about alternatives.

You should also talk to your doctor before having the vaccine if you have:

- A bleeding disorder
- A history of seizures
- Any problems with your nervous system
- An immune system disorder called [Guillain-Barre syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-guillain-barre)

The tetanus vaccine may interact with certain medicines you take. Tell your doctor if you take:

- Corticosteroids
- Cancer drugs
- Medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants)

## Tetanus Vaccine Ingredients

The vaccine contains the bacteria that cause tetanus. But they have been "deactivated" in a lab. This means they are not live bacteria and are not able to cause the disease. But they will still cause your body to create an immune response that will protect you in the future.

## Tetanus Vaccine Risks

It's important to know that, in general, the risk of problems from getting tetanus is much greater than from getting a tetanus vaccine. You cannot get tetanus from the tetanus shot.

Rare risks are:

- Severe allergic reaction
- Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
- Bad muscle aches and weakness

Also rare, small children may have more serious side effects from the DTap vaccine, such as:

- [Seizures](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/understanding-seizures-basics)
- Fever above 105 F
- Continuous crying for a few hours or more

## Tetanus Vaccine Side Effects

Sometimes, the tetanus vaccine can cause mild side effect, such as:

- Soreness, redness, or swelling at the site of the injection
- Low fever
- [Headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-migraines) or body aches
- Fatigue
- Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
- Loss of appetite
- Fussiness in babies and small children

## Where to Get a Tetanus Vaccine

You can get a tetanus vaccine at your doctor's office. They also may be available at local pharmacies, health departments, health centers, or other clinics.

**Tetanus injection price**

The price of a tetanus shot depends on your insurance coverage. Many plans cover the cost completely. With some plans you'll need to pay a copay. If you don't have insurance, a booster shot will cost you about $60.

## Takeaways

The tetanus vaccine protects against tetanus, which is a serious bacterial infection. You should have a series of tetanus vaccines during childhood. As an adult, you should get a booster vaccine every 10 years. Talk to your doctor if you think you're behind on your vaccines or if you've never had a tetanus shot.

## Tetanus Shot FAQs

**How often do you really need a tetanus shot?**

After you're fully vaccinated, most doctors recommend that you receive a booster tetanus shot every 10 years.

**Is Tdap the same as tetanus?**

Tdap is a combination vaccine, which means it contains two or more vaccines in the same shot. Tdap protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough).

**How long does the tetanus shot last?**

The tetanus shot lasts at least 10 years. Some studies have found it may last longer, but more research is needed to confirm those findings.

**What ages do you need tetanus shots?**

Children need a DTaP shot at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 and 18 months, and between 4 years and 6 years. After that, they will need one dose of Tdap between ages 8 and 11. Then, doctors recommend a booster every 10 years.

## What Are Lung Sounds?

When you go for a sick visit or your annual checkup at your doctor's office, they will likely listen to your chest through a stethoscope. Part of what they're listening for is the sounds your lungs make as you breathe in and out. Listening to your lung sounds gives your doctor a clue about how well your lungs are working.

There are three types of normal lung sounds that are different depending on where in your chest your doctor is listening. The three normal lung sounds are bronchial, bronchovesicular, and vesicular.

**Bronchial lung sounds**

Your doctor can hear these most clearly when you breathe out. They'll listen high in your chest and over your windpipe for loud, rough, and high-pitched lung sounds. These sounds are normal in your bronchial area, but may be abnormal in other areas of your lungs.

**Bronchovesicular lung sounds**

Your doctor can hear these sounds when you breathe in and out. They'll listen in the middle part of your chest for sounds are lower-pitched than bronchial lung sounds but higher-pitched than vesicular lung sounds.

**Vesicular lung sounds**

Your doctor can hear these sounds best when you breathe in. They'll listen in your mid-back for soft, smooth, low-pitched sounds. These tell your doctor that nothing (like mucus) is blocking your airways, and there's no swelling or narrowing that's stopping you from taking a full breath.

**Adventitious lung sounds**

Adventitious sounds are ones that your doctor hears in addition to the normal sounds. These noises can help your doctor identify problems in your lungs. For instance, lung conditions like bronchitis or pneumonia can cause adventitious lung sounds. The five most common abnormal lung sounds are:

- Wheezing
- Rales (also called crackles)
- Stridor
- Rhonchi or rhonchus
- Pleural rub

Read on to learn more about these common types of adventitious lung sounds and a few less common ones.

## Wheezing Lung Sounds

A wheeze (or sibilant rhonchus) is a continuous, high-pitched lung sound. Wheezing may be easier to hear when you breathe out, but sometimes you can hear it when you’re breathing in and out. You may even be able to hear wheezing without a stethoscope. Wheezing indicates you have a narrowed airway that limits the flow of air in and out of your lungs.

**Wheezing causes**

The most common causes of wheezing include:

- Asthma, which is a lung disease that makes your airways swollen, narrow, and blocked by excess mucus
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a group of long-term, inflammatory lung conditions that limit airflow in your lungs. Some examples include emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
- Cystic fibrosis, which is a condition where thick mucus clogs your airways and makes it difficult to breathe.
- Upper respiratory infections, such as pneumonia or infections caused by bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
- Tumors in your lungs
- Breathing something into your lungs or getting an object stuck in your windpipe.
- Vocal cord dysfunction, which makes your vocal cords close instead of open when you breathe. This makes it harder to get air into and out of your lungs.
- Chronic acid reflux can cause the valve that connects your esophagus and stomach to loosen. This lets stomach acid get into your esophagus and windpipe, which may cause wheezing.
- Allergies and severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Sleep apnea, which is a sleep breathing disorder that may cause you to stop breathing periodically while you're asleep.

You can also start wheezing if you smoke or as a side effect of some medications (such as aspirin if you have asthma).

## Rales (Crackles) Lung Sounds

Rales, or crackles, are discontinuous, interrupted, or explosive lung sounds. They may sound like pulling velcro open. The sounds can be short and high-pitched, or they may last a bit longer and be lower-pitched. Your doctor is more likely to hear crackles when you’re breathing in, but they may happen when you breathe out, too. Rales happen when your airway snaps open as you breathe in.

**Rales causes**

Common causes of short, high-pitched rales (fine crackles) include:

- Pneumonia, which is an infection in your lungs. It causes your lung tissues to swell and may cause fluid or pus to build up in your airways.
- Congestive heart failure, which is a long-term condition where your heart can’t pump blood well enough to meet your body’s needs. Because your blood isn't circulating fast enough, it builds up in other parts of your body, usually your lungs, legs, and feet.
- Interstitial lung disease, which is a group of long-term, inflammatory lung conditions that cause scarring in your lungs. It can be caused by certain medications, radiation therapy, connective tissue diseases, or inhaling harmful substances, like asbestos.

Longer, low-pitched rales (coarse crackles) are caused by the same conditions as fine crackles but suggest a more advanced state of the condition.

## Stridor Lung Sounds

Stridor is a continuous, rough, high-pitched whistle or squeaking lung sound. Your doctor is more likely to hear it when you breathe in. Like wheezing, stridor suggests you have blocked airflow, but it happens more in your upper airway or throat than in your chest.

**Stridor causes**

Causes of stridor include:

- An upper airway infection, especially in kids. Your doctor may call this viral croup.
- Swelling in your throat from tonsillitis or epiglottitis, which is when the “lid” of cartilage that covers your windpipe swells and blocks your airflow.
- An object stuck in your windpipe
- Injury to your windpipe
- A tumor in your voice box
- An allergic reaction
- A pocket of pus (abscess) in your throat
- Vocal cord dysfunction or paralysis
- Inhaling smoke or chemicals

## Rhonchi Lung Sounds

Rhonchi (also called sonorous rhonchi) are loud, continuous, low-pitched, snoring, or gurgling lung sounds. Your doctor may be able to hear them best when you’re breathing out, but they may also hear them when you breathe in and out. The sound might move around to different parts of your chest when you cough as mucus moves around. These sounds happen because your larger airways are narrowed by mucus, and they flutter as air flows through.

**Rhonchi causes**

Wheezing and rhonchi have a similar cause (narrowed airways usually due to fluid buildup), so the causes are mostly the same. For instance, rhonchi is often caused by:

- Pneumonia
- COPD

## Pleural Friction Rub Lung Sounds

Pleural rub is a rough, scratching, or grating lung sound. Your doctor will hear it when you breathe in and out. It's usually louder than other lung sounds since it's happening in your chest wall. You get pleural rub when the linings of your lungs (pleura) swell and rub against each other.

**Pleural friction rub causes**

Possible causes of pleural rub include:

- Viral or bacterial infections, such as those caused by the flu or pneumonia
- Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
- Lung or pleural conditions, such as mesothelioma, tuberculosis, or asbestosis
- Chest surgery or trauma
- A blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolism)
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Sickle cell disease
- Certain medicines, such as hydralazine, isoniazid, or procainamide

## Whooping Lung Sounds

Whooping is a loud, high-pitched gasp lung sound. You may make this noise when you gasp for air after a coughing fit. You will be able to hear this when you breathe in as you fill your lungs after expelling all your air when coughing.

**Whooping causes**

The most common cause of whooping lung sounds is an infection with a bacteria called _Bordetella pertussis,_ commonly called whooping cough _._

## Hamman's Sign Lung Sounds

Hamman's sign is a crunchy or scratchy lung sound that happens in time with your heartbeat. This sound indicates that you have air trapped in the space between your lungs (a medical condition called pneumomediastinum). The sound is caused by shifting of the trapped air from the movement of your heart as it beats.

**Hamman's sign causes**

The most common causes of pneumomediastinum include:

- Severe injury to your chest
- Surgery to your chest
- Rupture to the small structures in your lungs, called alveoli
- A tear in your airway or your gastrointestinal (GI) tract
- Infection in your chest from bacteria, fungi, or viruses
- Things that suddenly increase the pressure in your chest, such as coughing, sneezing, or vomiting
- Straining while pooping
- Pushing during childbirth
- Inhaling recreational drugs
- Scuba diving
- Mechanical ventilation, for instance during surgery

## Infant Lung Sounds

Infants with breathing problems may make persistent noises, such as:

- A hoarse cry and a "barking" cough. This may mean your baby has croup, which is an infection of the voicebox, windpipe, and bronchial tubes.
- Stridor. This may come from extra tissue around their voice box (laryngomalacia). It may be worse when your baby lies on their back. They usually grow out of this by the time they're 2 years old.
- Rales. This may be an indication that your baby has pneumonia.
- Wheezing and a deep cough. This may suggest that your baby has a block in their airway.

## Lung Sound Tests

Your doctor can get important information about the health of your lungs by listening closely as you breathe. The easiest and most common way to do this is to hold a stethoscope to the skin on your back and chest. This is called auscultation.

As your doctor listens, they’ll ask you to take deep breaths through your mouth. They also may ask you to speak certain phrases and see how they sound through your chest or back. Some examples of this include:

[**Bronchophony**](https://www.webmd.com/lung/lung-sounds)

Your doctor will ask you to say “ninety-nine.” Normally, your lungs will muffle the words. If the words sound clear through the stethoscope, it may be a sign that your lungs are filled with blood, fluid, or mucus.

**Whispered pectoriloquy**

This involves whispering “ninety-nine” or “one, two, three.” Healthy lungs will dampen the sound and make the words faint, but they’ll be louder if your lungs are filled with fluid.

**Egophony**

If you have fluid in your lungs, your doctor uses this test to check for a collapsed lung. As you say an “e” sound, your doctor will listen to see if it’s muffled and sounds like “e” or if it’s louder and sounds like “a,” which means fluid is changing the sound.

## When to Contact the Doctor About Lung Sounds

If you notice you have abnormal or changes in your breathing sounds, you should go get checked out by your doctor.

And if you have any of the following symptoms, call 911 and get to the ER right away:

- Bluish discoloration of your skin
- Nasal flaring
- Severe trouble breathing or shortness of breath
- You start wheezing suddenly after a bug bite or after eating a food you may be allergic to

## Takeaways

As part of your physical exam, your doctor will listen to your lung sounds through a stethoscope. Part of what they are listening for is adventitious lung sounds, which are sounds your lungs make in addition to your normal breathing sounds. The five major adventitious lung sounds are wheezing, rales, stridor, rhonchi, and pleural rub. Various conditions cause different sounds, although there can be overlap. Lung sounds are one clue your doctor uses to help them figure out what is causing you to have breathing problems.

## Lung Sounds FAQs

**What lung sounds does pneumonia have?**

This depends on whether you have viral or bacterial pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia tends to be more severe than viral pneumonia. People with bacterial pneumonia can have wheezing, rales, rhonchi, and pleural rub. People with viral pneumonia may only have a dry cough.

**What do congested lungs sound like?**

Congestion in your lungs is usually due to mucus or swelling. If you have congestion, you may have wheezing, rales, rhonchi, and pleural rub.

## Fasting and Diabetes

There's a lot of buzz about fasting — that is, not eating for a certain period or cutting back drastically — for better health. You may want to fast to eat fewer calories and lose weight. Or maybe fasting is part of your religious practice. But if you have diabetes, is it safe and will it help you lose weight, control your blood sugar, and maybe even need less medicine?

Perhaps. Some studies suggest fasting may be helpful for people with diabetes. But it's not a mainstream treatment. The American Diabetes Association recommends making lifestyle changes, including medical nutrition therapy and more physical activity, as the cornerstones for weight loss and good diabetes control.

If you're thinking of trying a fast and you have diabetes, you'll want to know what the risks are, how to avoid them, and why you should check with your doctor first to make sure fasting is safe for you.

## Intermittent Fasting and Diabetes

Intermittent fasting is a popular eating plan that many claim improves overall health. You may have heard this trend helps people lose weight, improves blood sugar control, and reduces blood pressure, cholesterol, and inflammation.

But what exactly is intermittent fasting? This diet plan involves eating only during specific periods of the day or week and fasting — or not eating anything — the rest of the time. The idea is to reset your eating patterns and get used to being satisfied with fewer calories by not constantly snacking. Some fasts don't allow any food at all. But on intermittent plans, you follow a pattern of fasting and then eat normally.

Three types of intermittent fasting plans include alternate day fasting, 5:2 fasting, and time-restricted eating.

**Alternate day fasting**

For this plan, you follow your regular diet one day and then eat around 500 calories (or 25% of your normal calorie intake) the next day, repeating this pattern throughout the week. This eating pattern may be challenging if you have diabetes because your blood sugar is directly affected by how much food you eat. In this case, on fasting days, you'll struggle to maintain a normal blood sugar if your body doesn't produce enough insulin (common in type 1 diabetes) or if your body doesn't use insulin properly (common in type 2 diabetes). If you have diabetes, doctors don't recommend alternate day fasting on your own. Rather, work closely with your doctor to make sure you are fasting safely — or to make sure you can fast at all.

**5:2 fasting**

The popular 5:2 plan has you eat a regular healthy diet five days a week and cut down to about 500-800 calories on the other two days. Similar to alternate day fasting, if you have type 1 or 2 diabetes, you can do 5:2 fasting under the close supervision of your doctor. Your doctor may adjust your medication schedule and dosages and give you instructions on how frequently to check your blood sugar.

**Time-restricted eating**

This plan is when you get all your calories for the day during a specific number of hours. For instance, on an eight-hour plan, you might eat from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and then not again until the next day at 10 a.m. This fasting plan is a good option if you have diabetes because the consistent eating schedule makes it easier for your doctor to adjust your medication, if needed.

Some people fast for several days or even weeks at a time — for example, for religious reasons. But not eating for more than 24 hours when you have diabetes can be dangerous. If fasting for religious reasons is important to you, talk with your doctor about how to fast safely. Your doctor will support you with recommendations from science-backed guidelines.

## Is Fasting Good for Diabetes?

More research is needed to know if fasting is safe long term, whether you have diabetes or not. Most studies on the effects of intermittent fasting have been done on overweight, middle-aged adults. More research is needed to determine if it is safe for people who are older or younger or people already at a healthy weight.

Fasting may have some general health benefits. For example, it could cut down on [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation), help with weight loss, and [lower cholesterol](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/default.htm). Fasting may also improve the way your body manages glucose (blood sugar). The American Diabetes Association notes that if you're [overweight](https://www.webmd.com/obesity/what-obesity-is) or have [obesity](https://www.webmd.com/obesity/video/obesity-risks), weight loss can help lower your [A1c level](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/glycated-hemoglobin-test-hba1c) (a gauge of your blood sugar control over the last two to three months) and lower your risk of [heart disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/default.htm). But fasting isn't required for weight loss.

Fasting may also affect how much insulin medication you need. In one study, people with [type 1 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-1-diabetes) who stuck with a fasting plan were able to lower their insulin dose.

Some organs that play a role in diabetes may benefit from fasting, too. Your body stores extra glucose in a form called glycogen in your [liver](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-liver-failure). It takes your body about 12 hours to use that glycogen. If you don't eat, your body begins to burn [fat](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/good-fat-bad-fat) instead of glycogen for energy. That helps with weight loss. It also gives your liver and [pancreas](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-pancreatitis) (which makes insulin, the [hormone](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/endocrine-system-disorders) that controls blood sugar) a break.

## Can Intermittent Fasting Help Reverse Diabetes?

There is not enough evidence to prove that intermittent fasting reverses diabetes. While more research is needed, several recent scientific studies suggest that intermittent fasting is safe and beneficial for people with diabetes. A 2023 study shows that time-restricted eating helps people with type 2 diabetes lose weight and improves long-term blood sugar control.

Another 2023 study suggests that intermittent fasting may lead to type 2 diabetes remission. But findings of this study are limited by a small sample size (number of people studied) and a very specific type of fasting (Chinese Medicine Nutrition Therapy) that is not mainstream in the U.S.

If you have diabetes and are interested in the possible benefits of intermittent fasting, here's the bottom line: Consult with your doctor who will help you choose the best fasting option and develop a plan to help you fast safely.

## Risks of Fasting With Diabetes

When you fast, you'll probably be hungry (at least at first). Eating fewer calories than you're used to may make you feel drowsy and irritable. Not eating may give you a headache. While these feelings are common and generally harmless, it's important to be aware of the more serious risks of fasting with diabetes. Always talk to your doctor before you make major changes to your diet.

**Malnutrition**

If you fast for more than a day or so, your body may not get enough of the protein, vitamins, and minerals it needs without supplements. This may lead to malnutrition, a condition that develops when your body doesn't have enough nutrients to stay healthy. Your risk of malnutrition is high if you eat less than 1,200 calories a day long term.

**Dehydration**

Calorie-free fluids are not restricted in intermittent fasting, so you can drink as much water, diet soda, unsweetened tea, and black coffee as you want. But the risk of dehydration when fasting is high because cutting certain foods from your diet means you're also cutting fluids. For example, soups, yogurt, and fruits like melon, berries, and pineapple are made up of mostly water. So it's important to drink extra fluids to make up for the fluid loss from not eating these water-containing foods.

Some diabetes drugs, especially sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, can make dehydration worse. Make sure to talk with your doctor about your medication plan while fasting to lower your risk of dehydration.

**Hypoglycemia**

The biggest danger of fasting if you have diabetes is that your blood sugar levels could go dangerously low (a condition called hypoglycemia). That's especially true if you take medication like insulin to control your diabetes. If you don't eat, your blood sugar levels are lower and medication may drop them even more, which can lead to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can cause you to feel shaky, pass out, or even go into a coma.

**Hyperglycemia**

When you "break" your fast by eating, you may also be more likely to develop too high blood sugar levels. Doctors call this hyperglycemia. This only happens if you eat too many carbohydrates. If fasting prompts you to overeat carbohydrate-rich foods, it may not be the right plan for you.

## Before You Try Fasting

**Talk to your doctor first.** If you have type 1 diabetes, have other health problems due to diabetes, or have had hypoglycemia, your doctor may recommend you not fast.

If your doctor says it's OK to try, ask if you need to [check your blood sugar](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-complications-reduce-risk) more often or adjust your diabetes medication during and after fasting.

**Watch for signs of low blood sugar.** If you start to feel shaky, sweaty, or confused, your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cm/rm-quiz-blood-basics) sugar may be too low. Stop fasting right away and do what you normally would to treat hypoglycemia. For example, eat a glucose gel or have a sugary drink followed by a small, balanced meal when your [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/high-cholesterol-healthy-heart) sugar level is back to normal.

**Be careful about what you eat after fasting.** Eating too many carbohydrates after fasting can cause your blood sugar levels to become too high. Choose healthy, balanced meals and snacks.

**Use caution.** Don't do tough workouts while you're fasting. Hard [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-7-most-effective-exercises) can make your blood sugar levels dip, which can lead to hypoglycemia. Ask your doctor what activities are OK to do, or just take a break.

**Stay hydrated.** Having diabetes puts you at a risk of [dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults), which can make your blood sugar harder to manage. Drink lots of [water](https://www.webmd.com/diet/how-much-water-to-drink) and calorie-free beverages when you fast.

**Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly.** It's important to regularly monitor your blood sugar levels while fasting to prevent hypoglycemia. When starting your fast, test your blood glucose levels more often to understand how your body reacts to fewer calories. You can also use a continuous glucose monitoring system, a fingerstick-free method way to closely monitor your blood sugar levels. Knowing your blood sugar levels early in your fast may help you predict and avoid hypoglycemia.

## Takeaways

Intermittent fasting is a dietary approach that involves eating only during specific periods of the day or week and eating nothing (or much less) the rest of the time. It may be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes, but more research is needed to prove these claims. If you have diabetes and want to try intermittent fasting, work closely with your doctor to help you choose the most appropriate fasting plan. Before you start your fast, know how often you should monitor your blood sugar levels and how to avoid and manage dehydration, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia.

## Fasting and Diabetes FAQs

**Can diabetes be reversed with fasting?**

Some studies show that fasting helps people with type 2 diabetes lose weight and improve blood sugar control, but more research is needed to learn about the long-term effects of fasting and reversing diabetes.

**How long should I fast for diabetes?**

It's up to you to decide how long you want to fast if you have diabetes. But it's important to make this decision with your doctor to be sure that you're fasting safely. It's especially important to stop your fast when you have hypoglycemia.

**Can fasting raise blood sugar?**

Fasting does not raise blood sugar, but you may have a sharp rise in blood sugar levels if you eat too many carbs when you "break" your fast by eating.

**How long can someone with diabetes go without eating?**

There is not a set time at which fasting becomes dangerous if you have diabetes. Instead, your blood sugar levels indicate if you can safely go on without eating. If your blood sugar levels drop dangerously low (hypoglycemia), you need to eat or drink something sugary quickly to avoid passing out or going into a coma. Talk to your doctor before you begin fasting to determine if you can safely do so.

If you're being manipulated by someone, they're trying to control how you act and take away your ability to think for yourself. This tactic can affect not only your relationship with them, but your relationships with others and your mental health.

To deal with a manipulative person, it's crucial to set firm boundaries and stick to them.

## What Is Manipulation?

Manipulation means pressuring others, sometimes in sneaky ways, to get what you want. The person doing the manipulating, called the manipulator, seeks to be in control. They're usually very good at reading emotions but use that skill to pick up on your weaknesses and take advantage of you. The end goal of manipulative behavior? To gain personal or professional power.

Manipulation can happen in any type of relationship, from the workplace to your family, although it's most common in close relationships. It includes any attempt to sway your emotions to try to get you to act or feel a certain way.

**Common manipulative behaviors**

Manipulators have common tricks they use so that you're more likely to give in to their requests. A few common examples include:

**They try to make you feel guilty.** A manipulator can skew any situation to make themselves the victim. Or they might remind you of times they've helped you out, making it seem like you owe them.

**They encourage you to doubt yourself.** If you're repeatedly told that you can't do something or don't understand, you may start to believe it. Manipulators often use this technique to get you to stop doing something.

**They complain.** Getting angry, especially in front of others, is a way to coerce you into doing what they want. They're betting that you want to quickly end the conflict, especially if they're making a scene.

**They compare you to others.** By pointing out what someone else has achieved, a manipulator is really pointing out your shortcomings. It's a way to make you feel "less than," although they may insist they're trying to motivate you.

**They charm you.** Not all manipulative behavior comes across as negative. Some manipulators may shower you with compliments and praise to build your trust. That way, you're more likely to do what they want.

**They give ultimatums.** In some cases, a manipulator will make threats to get their way. For instance, they may threaten to move out of your house, quit their job, or even harm themselves.

## Signs of Manipulation

Manipulation can take many forms. In fact, even acting kind can be a form of manipulation if the person's intent is not to genuinely help you, but only to get something for themselves.

**Common manipulation tactics**

People who manipulate others often have very high emotional intelligence (EI). EI is usually a good skill to have because it helps you understand what others may be thinking or feeling. But in this case, EI helps a manipulator:

- Quickly spot your weaknesses and figure out how to use them against you
- Persuade you to give up something important to you, so you start to rely on them
- Not give up easily. Once they succeed in their manipulation, they'll likely continue to do so until you get out of the situation.

Common manipulation strategies include:

**Location advantage**

A manipulator will try to bring you out of your comfort zone and places that you're familiar with to have an advantage over you. This can be in any place that the manipulator feels ownership of or in control.

**Manipulation of facts**

A manipulator will lie to you, make excuses, blame you, or strategically share some facts and withhold other truths. In doing this, they feel they're gaining power over you and are smarter than you.

**Exaggeration and generalization**

Manipulators exaggerate and generalize. They may say things like, “No one has ever loved me.” They use vague accusations to make it harder for you to see the holes in their arguments.

**Cruel humor**

This tactic is meant to poke fun at your weaknesses and make you feel insecure. Making others look bad is a way that manipulators can feel better about themselves.

**Gaslighting**

This tactic is used by manipulators to confuse you and make you question your own reality. It happens when you confront their abuse or lies and the manipulator tells you that it never happened.

**Passive aggression**

A passive-aggressive manipulator doesn’t voice negative feelings toward you. Instead, they find subtle, indirect ways to express their anger and undermine you.

For instance, they might agree to do your work project, then seek passive-aggressive ways to let you know they don’t really want to be doing it. For instance, they could act sullen, although they insist nothing's wrong. Or they might make mistakes on purpose or slack off to try to sabotage your project.

It's worth nothing that people can be passive aggressive for many reasons that aren’t always intended to manipulate. But chronic (long-term) manipulators will use this tactic to make you feel guilty. It's a way for them to show anger without directly being angry, making you feel confused.

**Social and emotional bullying**

Bullies don’t always use physical violence. Constant criticism, raised voices, and threats are all forms of emotional [bullying](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/how-does-bullying-affect-mental-health). Social bullying can take the form of rumor spreading or purposely making you feel left out.

Other forms include intellectual and bureaucratic bullying. In intellectual bullying, someone tries to claim the role of subject matter expert, making you feel like you don't know anything and have to depend on them. Bureaucratic bullying is the use of red tape – laws, procedures, or paperwork – to overwhelm you and thwart your goals.

**Distortion**

Another strategy used by emotionally manipulative people is to twist facts or other information that you need to properly understand a situation.

In some cases, the manipulator will simply lie or claim something didn't happen.

**Guilt and sympathy**

Guilt is an emotion that many people easily feel. Manipulators prey on this sensitivity. They know that making you feel bad makes them more likely to get what they want.

**Withdrawal**

The simplest example of this kind of manipulative behavior is the silent treatment, when someone punishes you by ignoring you.

**Comparison**

Sometimes a manipulative person will compare you to someone else in order to goad you. They may use a specific person to make you feel insecure or try to establish a sense that “everyone else” is doing whatever they want you to do. They may even recruit others to pressure you into a certain emotion or action.

**Love-bombing**

Showering someone with praise and affection, also called “ [love-bombing](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/what-is-love-bombing),” is a common manipulation tactic. It's even used in cults. It happens because the manipulator is trying to speed up your relationship so you feel more attached to them.

**Constant judging**

A manipulator may also be brazen about judging you, making fun of you, and making you feel bad about yourself. They want to make you feel like you’re doing something wrong, and that no matter what you do, you won't be as good as them. They only focus on what they view as your negative aspects and don't offer comments that lift you up and support you.

## Treating Manipulation

It can feel hard to admit that you're being manipulated, especially by someone you have a close relationship with. But manipulation can take an emotional toll on you, so it's important that you find a safe way out of the situation.

**How to identify manipulation**

You're more likely to be manipulated if you:

- Are a people pleaser and like to make others happy
- Seek others' approval
- Often find yourself saying yes, when you want to say no
- Easily see the best in people
- Tend to want to stay in relationships, even if you're unhappy in them

if you think you're being manipulated by someone in your life:

- Take a step back and try to assess the situation. What are the facts? Focus on those instead of your beliefs or opinions.
- Trust your gut. What does your intuition tell you about this person and their treatment of you?

It's not your fault if you are being manipulated. But once you realize it, there are things you can do to reduce how much it affects you.

The most important strategy? Put some distance between you and the person who's trying to pressure you into doing what they want.

**How to set boundaries**

Think of boundaries as a framework for how you want to be treated. They help you respect yourself and encourage others to do the same. When you set healthy boundaries, you're better able to protect yourself emotionally and physically.

If this concept is new to you, you might start by asking yourself what you need from others to be happy and how much time and energy you have for other people in your life. If you're a people pleaser, take some time to think about _your_ feelings – not what others want from you.

To set strong boundaries with a manipulative person, you might decide to:

- Limit how often you see them, if that's possible. That will make it easier to contain your relationship, although in extreme cases, you may need to cut off all contact.
- Don't overshare. The more a manipulator knows about you, the more they can use those details against you. Try to keep your conversations brief and general.
- Stay neutral. Manipulators thrive on drama, so try not to give them any. Respond neutrally when they attempt to get you worked up. For instance, you could shrug, avoid making eye contact, or only give short, unemotional answers.
- Take a moment. Pause before you agree to anything a manipulative person asks of you. Take a moment (or longer) and ask yourself what it is that you really want to do, separate from their request.

Deciding which boundaries to set often depends on how manipulative the person is.

## Support and Resources

If you feel like someone may be trying to manipulate you – whether it's a partner, relative, friend, co-worker, or anyone else – it's important to get support, especially if the situation is abusive in any way. Some people you can reach out to include:

- A relationship counselor
- Therapist
- Close friends
- Trusted family members
- [National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/): 800-799-SAFE (7233) or text START to 88788

Call 911 if you're in immediate danger.

## How to Stop Manipulating

Research shows that you're more likely to manipulate others if you have narcissistic personality traits. Narcissistic personality disorder is a condition in which you have an excessively high opinion of yourself. You need attention and admiration from others, but you're not inclined to care about their feelings. And you'll take advantage of others to get what you want or think you deserve.

Narcissistic personality disorder is more common in men than it is in women.

If you're able to admit that you manipulate others for your own benefit, professional support can help you stop. You may think that talking to a therapist isn't worth your time, but try to keep an open mind. Therapy can help you understand what motivates you to take advantage of others and show you healthier ways to communicate. You'll likely see your relationships with others improve and be better able to manage your feelings.

## Takeaways

Manipulation means trying to control another person so they will do what you want because it benefits you. Firm boundaries are necessary to protect yourself from a manipulator. If you're not sure how to safely end a manipulative relationship, seek help from a counselor, trusted friend, family member, or a domestic violence nonprofit.

Testicles, also called testes or balls, are oval-shaped organs that sit in a sac that hangs behind the [penis](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/how-an-erection-occurs).

The main job of testicles is to make sperm and produce testosterone. Testosterone is the male hormone that's responsible for the changes that occur during puberty. [Puberty](https://teens.webmd.com/default.htm) is the time in life when your body begins to change and you start to look more and more like an adult.

After puberty is finished, the testicles will produce millions of [sperm](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/sperm-and-semen-faq) a day. Sperm mixes with a white, milky substance to make semen. [Semen](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/marks-semen-analysis) is what's released from the penis when you ejaculate.

Guys become fertile between the ages of 11 and 17, meaning they are able to ejaculate semen and get a girl [pregnant](https://www.webmd.com/baby/default.htm).

## When will my testicles begin to grow?

Your testicles will grow in the early stages of puberty, between the ages of 10 to 13. As your testicles grow, the skin around the scrotum -- the sac that holds the testicles -- will darken, hang down, and begin to develop hair.

## How big are testicles?

On average, testicles grow to be about 2 to 3 inches in length and 1 inch in width.

## Is it normal to have one testicle that's bigger than the other?

Yes. It is common for guys to have slightly different size testicles. Usually, the right testicle is larger than the left. Also, one testicle (usually the left) often hangs lower than the other.

## Why does my scrotum shrink when I get cold?

For your testicles to produce sperm, they must be kept at just the right temperature. As a result, the scrotum will change size to make sure the testicles stay at that right temperature. This happens without you even thinking about it. So, when you are cold, your body sends a message to the scrotum to shrivel and preserve heat.

## Why do my testicles hang down?

Just as your body directs your scrotum to shrivel when it is cold, your body tells the scrotum to loosen up when you are too warm. Your scrotum will become larger and more floppy to release extra heat.

## What if I have painful or swollen testicles?

Many things can cause painful or [swollen testicles](https://www.webmd.com/men/inflammation-testicle-orchitis), including:

- Fluid collecting in an area surrounding a testicle, a condition known as a [hydrocele](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/hydrocele-baby-boys).
- Infection, such as from a virus or a [sexually transmitted disease](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/default.htm) (STD) like [chlamydia](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/chlamydia)
- Inguinal hernia. That's a condition in which a part of the intestines pushes into the groin or scrotum through an abnormal opening or a weak spot in the abdominal wall.
- Injury to the testicles, such as from being kicked, hit, or crushed.
- Swelling in a vein that drains blood away from a testicle, a condition called varicocele.
- Testicular cancer.
- Testicular torsion, an extremely painful condition that occurs when a testicle gets twisted.

If you think you have [testicular torsion](https://www.webmd.com/men/testicle-injuries), see a doctor right away. This is a serious medical emergency.

If you notice any pain or swelling in or around your testicles, tell a parent and have it examined by a doctor as soon as possible. Many different types of testicle problems are linked to pain and swelling in the testicles. It's not always easy to tell which episode could lead to more serious problems if ignored. Play it safe and get checked.

## Could I have testicular cancer?

[Testicular cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-testicular-cancer-basics) occurs when cells in the testicle divide abnormally and form a tumor. You may think you're too young to worry about it. But you're not, especially if you’re over the age of 14. Testicular cancer typically affects males between the ages of 14 and 35. And it's the most common cancer in this age group.

Testicular cancer is not very common. There are about 8,300 new cases a year. And about 500 men die each year from this cancer. But while some men are more likely to get it than others, it's possible for any young man to get the disease.

The most common symptom of testicular cancer is a painless lump on a testicle. Other symptoms may include:

- An enlarged or swollen testicle, with or without [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm)
- A heavy, aching feeling in the lower stomach, low back, or groin

## Should I give myself a monthly testicular self-exam?

Unless you have certain risk factors, such as a brother or father who has or had testicular cancer, the American Cancer Society (ACS) says there aren't enough studies to make monthly exams a recommendation.

But, because the cancer is so easy to treat when found early, some doctors recommend the exam. Besides finding cancer early, the exam can help you find other problems that may need to be treated.

## How do I do a testicular exam?

Some doctors recommend that boys start doing monthly exams as early as 14. At this age, it's unlikely that you’ll find anything to be concerned about. However, a self-exam will give you the chance to get to know your body so that you can detect changes more easily in the future.

The best time to do an exam is right after a shower or bath. That's when the skin of the scrotum will be most relaxed and the exam will be easier to do. You should do the exam standing in front of a mirror. If you are nervous about touching yourself, don't be. This is how you get to know what your testicles and scrotum should feel like.

- Start by standing in front of the mirror and checking for any swelling in the scrotum. Cup the scrotum in one hand to see if it feels normal.
- Hold your [penis](https://www.webmd.com/men/cm/rm-quiz-is-my-penis-normal) out of the way and examine one testicle at a time.
- Roll the testicle gently between the fingers and thumb. You should not feel any pain.
- The testicle may be about the size of a golf ball, and it should feel smooth.
- Feel for any bumps or changes in size or consistency.
- After checking one testicle, check the other the same way. One testicle may be slightly larger or smaller; this is normal.
- Lumps should be checked by a doctor.

You may notice bumps on the skin of your scrotum. These are often caused by an [ingrown hair](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ingrown-hair-causes-symptoms-treatment) or by a rash. They are usually not a cause for concern. You may also feel small, squishy lumps of tubes. These tubes are the sperm tubes that connect your testicles to the rest of your body. These small bumps are normal. But anything that feels different than usual should be checked by a doctor.

## When should I call a doctor?

If you find any lumps on your testicles when you do a self-exam, see a doctor right away. Also see a doctor if you notice any of these changes:

- One testicle has gotten noticeably larger or smaller.
- You have a dull ache in the lower abdomen or groin.
- You have a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum.
- You feel pain or discomfort in the scrotum or a testicle.
- You notice an enlargement or tenderness in your breasts.

Any of these could be a warning sign of cancer or something else, such as an infection. Only your doctor can diagnose what the problem is and decide on the proper treatment. Remember, the earlier a problem is found, whether it's cancer or something else, the more options there are for treating it and the easier it will be to treat.

## Month 4 of Pregnancy

In the [second trimester of pregnancy](https://www.webmd.com/baby/second-trimester-of-pregnancy) \-\- months 4, 5, and 6 -- your baby's fingers and toes are well-defined. Their eyelids, eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, and [hair](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics) are formed, and [teeth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/teeth-and-gum-care) and bones are becoming denser. Your baby can even suck their thumb, yawn, stretch, and make faces.

The nervous system is starting to function at this point in pregnancy. The reproductive organs and genitalia are now fully developed, and your healthcare provider can see on [ultrasound](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-an-ultrasound) if you are having a boy or a girl. Your baby's heartbeat may now be audible through an instrument called a Doppler.

By the end of the fourth month, your baby is about 6 inches long and weighs about 4 ounces.

![](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_and_medical_reference/womens_health/Pregnancy_Your_Babys_Growth_and_Development_Months_4_to_6_-_16_Weeks.jpg)

## Month 5 of Pregnancy

[Hair](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cm/rm-quiz-hair-care) is beginning to grow on your baby's head, and lanugo, a soft fine hair, covers their shoulders, back, and temples. This hair protects your baby and is usually shed at the end of the baby's first week of life.

Your [baby's skin](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/baby-skin-10/slideshow-newborn-skin-care) is covered with a whitish coating called vernix caseosa. This "cheesy" substance, thought to protect baby's skin from long exposure to the [amniotic fluid](https://www.webmd.com/baby/amniotic-fluid-volume-assessment), is shed just before birth.

You may begin to feel your baby move since they are developing muscles and exercising them. This first movement is called quickening.

By the end of the fifth month of pregnancy, your baby is about 10 inches long and weighs from 1/2 to 1 pound.

Now that you've read about your baby's development in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, take this quiz to test your smarts!

## Month 6 of Pregnancy

By the end of the sixth month, your baby is about 12 inches long and weighs about 2 pounds. their [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin) is reddish in color, wrinkled, and veins are visible through the baby's translucent skin. Baby's finger and toe prints are visible. The eyelids begin to part and the [eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes) open.

Your baby may respond to sounds by moving or increasing the pulse, and you may notice jerking motions if baby hiccups.

If born prematurely, your baby may survive after the 23rd week of pregnancy with intensive care.

## What Are Cock Rings?

Cock rings are rings that go around the penis and/or scrotum. They slow blood flow out of an erect penis and can help make erections harder and longer-lasting. Some also have knobs or little vibrators to increase pleasure for you and your partner.

Cock rings are also known as penis rings, tension rings, and constriction rings. They're sometimes marketed as [erectile dysfunction](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/default.htm) (ED) rings, but people without this condition use them too.

**Types of cock rings**

**Soft and stretchy rings.** These are the most common and generally the cheapest rings available. They're made of a soft material, often silicone. They’re easy to use and remove. It may take some trial and error to find the right fit.

**Adjustable cock rings.** These use lasso adjusters, Velcro, or other fasteners to allow the wearer to adjust the fit as needed.

**Vibrating cock rings.** These have a small vibrator attached. The sensation may feel good on your penis, but these are generally designed to stimulate a partner’s clitoris during sex.

**Solid cock rings.** These are best left to experienced users. Even then, you may want to avoid one-piece solid rings in favor of those with magnetic closures that make them easy to remove. Hard plastic or metal cock rings that fit poorly, get stuck, or are left on for too long pose a risk of penis strangulation. This is a medical emergency that happens when circulation to your penis is cut off.

## What Does a Cock Ring Do?

Cock rings can make sex more intense and last longer. Everyone is different, but for some people, their benefits include:

- A delayed and more pleasurable [orgasm](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/video/orgasm-sexual-response)
- Boosted confidence in your erection and sexual performance
- Help keeping an erection
- Added sensation for you and your partner

**Can you use a cock ring for masturbation?**

You can use a cock ring during masturbation. Because it takes longer to ejaculate and there's extra blood in your penis when you wear a cock ring, your orgasm might feel more intense.

## Myths About Cock Rings

Here are a few common misconceptions about cock rings:

**They’re only for people with erectile dysfunction**

Many people with no medical issues use cock rings. They may want the erection to last longer, increase sensitivity, or add a new element such as vibration or texture for their partner.

**They can be used as contraception**

Cock rings can't help you avoid [pregnancy](https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-resources#1) in any way.

**They hurt**

When you use them correctly, cock rings shouldn't cause pain. The sensation may take some getting used to, but if it hurts, remove the ring right away. It may be a symptom of something else or simply mean that you need a different size or style of ring.

**They can get stuck easily**

When used properly, a well-fitting cock ring shouldn't get stuck on your penis. But in rare cases, a cock ring that's too small or made of a hard material could be hard to remove. To avoid this problem, always choose a cock ring you can cut off or otherwise remove easily. Don't leave one on for more than 30 minutes. And never use any item as a cock ring that's not intended for that purpose.

## How to Put on a Cock Ring

Here are the basics of using a cock ring:

- Start when your penis isn't erect or is only partly erect. It's more difficult to put on a cock ring once you have an erection.
- Apply lube to your penis and the inside of the ring (water-based lube is best).
- Put the ring over the head of your penis, then slide it down toward the end of the shaft.
- If you're using a condom, put it on over the ring. But be sure the ring doesn't rub against the condom. That could cause it to rip.
- Use more lube as needed during sex.
- The ring should fit snugly but not cause discomfort. It should only slightly increase the size of your erection. If you feel pain or discomfort, or your penis starts to feel cold, take it off right away.
- Talk to your partner throughout the experience to make sure the ring feels OK to them.
- Take off the ring right after sex.

**How to put on a double cock ring**

A double cock ring, sometimes called a dual cock ring or penoscrotal ring, features two connected rings. One goes around the penis and the other fits around the scrotum, which further enhances sensation for some people. To use this type of ring, you generally put your testicles in the ring one by one, then insert the penis headfirst.

## How to Try Cock Rings Safely

**For beginners**

While you're learning how to use a cock ring, pick a beginner-friendly ring. It should be soft, stretchy, and easy to remove. Use the least constrictive size that still stays on and helps maintain your erection.

**For erectile dysfunction (ED)**

The best way to use a cock ring to help with ED will depend on your specific problem. If you can get an erection but have trouble keeping it, you can try the cock ring by itself.

If you struggle to get an erection, you may want to use your ring with a penis pump. The pump is a vacuum device your doctor can prescribe for ED. After pulling blood into your penis with the pump, slip your ring around the base of your penis before you remove the pump. The erection should last long enough for sex.

If you’re using the cock ring for erectile dysfunction, make sure you’ve talked to a doctor about your symptoms. Many health conditions can cause ED or make it worse, including heart disease, diabetes, alcohol problems, and mental health issues. It’s important to get help for those conditions and not use a sex toy to mask the symptoms.

**Safety measures**

Because cock rings restrict blood flow, it’s important not to wear one for longer than 30 minutes. Start by wearing one for just 5 minutes at a time to give yourself time to get used to the feeling. If you feel discomfort, take it off immediately.

Don't fall asleep while using the ring, and don’t use it while you’re impaired by drugs or alcohol. It could lead to injury.

Allow at least 60 minutes between uses.

## Care and Cleaning

Remember that sex toys can transmit [STIs](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/default.htm). You may also risk other kinds of infection if you don’t clean them properly.

For most toys, water and a mild dish soap or antibacterial hand soap should do the trick. If your device vibrates or otherwise uses power, you may not want to submerge it in water. But make sure you get it fully clean with soap and a damp cloth.

For further instructions, refer to the directions on your sex toy’s label. At the least, it should list the material your cock ring is made of, which may require special care.

## Size of Cock Rings

Because cock rings come in different shapes, sizes, and tightness, you may need to try a few before you find one that's right for your anatomy. One that's too loose won't be tight enough to do the job. One that's too small can cause discomfort and maybe even injure your penis by cutting off circulation.

Flexible cock rings can fit a range of penises but aren't usually one-size-fits-all. A well-fitting cock ring will stay in place when you're penis is soft but is still easy to get off when your penis is erect.

If you're shopping online, the manufacturer will likely provide a size chart. You may need to use a measuring tape or a string and rule to measure the width of your penis (or your penis and scrotum if you're using a ring that fits over both).

At an adult store, you can "try on" a cock ring using your fingers. Before you go, figure out how many of your fingers are roughly equal to the width of your penis.

## Who Should Not Use Cock Rings?

Don't use a cock ring while you're under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This could cause you to leave the ring on too long or ignore feelings of discomfort. Either can result in injury.

Also, talk to your doctor before using one if you:

- Take [blood-thinning medication](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/medical-reference/default.htm)
- Have a bleeding disorder
- Have a medical condition that affects your penis such as Peyronie’s disease, priapism, or a narrowing of your urethra (urethral stricture)

## Takeaways

Cock rings are rings that fit snugly around the bottom of penis and/or your scrotum. By slowing the flow of blood out of your penis, they may help make erections harder and longer-lasting. For safety purposes, make sure you:

- Use a ring that fits well.
- Don't leave one on for more than 30 minutes.
- Clean after each use.

## Cock Ring FAQs

**Do cock rings work?**

Not everyone is the same, but some people find that cock rings help them keep an erection longer and intensify orgasms.

How well they work for erectile dysfunction depends on your symptoms. If you're able to get an erection but have trouble keeping it, a cock ring might do the trick. If you have trouble getting erect, you'll need a penis pump along with a cock ring.

One small study found cock rings weren't effective for premature ejaculation, but we need more research on this.

**What are cock rings for?**

Cock rings may help your penis stay erect longer, delay your orgasm, and make it more intense. They work by reducing the flow of blood out of your penis.

**What is the right cock ring placement for beginners?**

It's probably simplest to start with a stretchy cock ring around the base of your penis.

**Where can you find cock ring tutorials?**

Different cock rings can be used in different ways. Manufacturers of some sex toys may provide tutorials on the product label or on their websites.

## What Is Salmon?

Salmon -- that tender, pink, firm fish -- is one of the most popular fish choices in America thanks in part to its rich, buttery flavor.

And that's a good thing for your health.

You can choose from a handful of different Pacific salmon, including:

- Sockeye
- Pink
- Coho
- King (Chinook)

Many of these come from the wild.

Atlantic salmon is also an option. The U.S. prohibits fishing for it, so the ones you’ll find in American supermarkets are farm-raised.

**Salmon pronunciation**

Salmon (/ˈsæm.ən/) is pronounced with a silent "l." The first part is said like "sa," while the last part sounds "muhn."

**Salmon color**

Salmon can come in different colors based on the type:

**Coho.** This type is larger and has fewer spots. It has a green head and a maroon flank (body) when it's mature.

**Chinook.** Mature versions tend to be brownish green with large peanut-shaped or 'W' spots.

**Steelhead.** These types of salmon have pink cheeks and flanks and smaller spots on their bodies and tails.

**Wild salmon vs. farmed salmon**

There are some differences between wild and farmed salmon:

**Fat content.** Three ounces of wild salmon has fewer calories and half of the amount of fat than that of farmed salmon. Farmed options also have more saturated fat. But wild salmon has less omega-3 fatty acids than farmed salmon.

**Pollutants.** PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) is a type of persistent organic pollutant (POP). There's 16 times more of this POP in farmed fish compared to wild fish. This is important because POPs are linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the risk of stroke in women.

**Contaminants.** Experts say that there are usually more contaminants in farmed salmon than in wild salmon. While the FDA considers the contaminant levels safe, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) don't consider farmed fish safe to eat too often.

Children, people of child-bearing age, and pregnant people should opt for wild salmon instead of farmed fish. And it's best to take off the skin of all types of fish to avoid as many contaminants and pollutants as possible.

**Chemicals that may cause cancer.** You may feel that you need to eat a lot of fish to get in your omega-3 fatty acids. But doing so, whether it's farmed or wild, could cause you to consume too many dangerous chemicals.

Wild salmon may come from polluted waters, while farmed fish get higher levels of PCB from their food. To be safe, eat fish in moderation and make sure you also get omega-3 fatty acids from other sources (like hemp seeds, soy, or chia seeds).

**Antibiotics.** In the 1990s and 2000s, Chilean salmon that was imported to Japan had a higher amount of antibiotics than regulations allowed. People were concerned that too much of this could cause [antibiotics t](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-are-antibiotics) o lose their beneficial effects. While it seems that farmed fish now have lower amounts  of antibiotics, it's still unclear how much is used on them. To avoid the confusion, wild salmon may be the better option for this situation.

## Salmon Nutrition Facts

A serving of salmon -- 3 to 4 ounces -- is about 200 calories. It's very low in saturated fat and a good source of protein. It's also one of the best sources of vitamin B12. It's also bursting in [potassium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-potassium) and other nutrients like iron and vitamin D.

Although most states have their own fish consumption advisories and recommended consumption levels, eating at least two servings of fish per week is generally considered part of a healthy diet.

- Salmon is an excellent source of:
- Vitamin B12
- Vitamin B6
- Potassium
- Vitamin D
- Selenium
- Phosphorous
- Iodine
- Choline
- Pantothenic acid
- Biotin
- [Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/omega-3-fatty-acids-fact-sheet)

**Salmon calories**

The calories in salmon will differ based on the type and the way you cook it. In 100 grams of cooked farmed salmon, there's about 200 calories. Wild salmon, on the other hand, has fewer calories. There are only about 180 calories in 100 grams of cooked wild salmon.

**Other nutrition facts**

One 3-ounce serving of grilled/baked wild Atlantic salmon contains:

- Calories: 175
- Fat: 11 grams
- [Carbohydrates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-carbs): 0 grams
- Sugar: 0 grams
- Protein: 19 grams
- Fiber: 0 grams
- Vitamin A: 1% of your daily recommended value (DRV)
- Vitamin C: 5% DRV
- Calcium: 1% DRV
- Iron: 2% DRV


## Salmon Benefits

Eating salmon provides numerous health benefits, including:

**Promoting heart health**

Due to its combination of omega-3 fatty acids and potassium, salmon is good for your heart for a variety of reasons. Eating salmon is known to:

- Reduce artery inflammation
- Lower cholesterol levels
- [Maintain blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/how-to-lower-blood-pressure)
- Prevent excess fluid retention
- Reduce heart attacks, strokes, arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat), high blood pressure, and high triglycerides

**Growing and maintaining hair and skin**

The essential omega-3 fatty acids in salmon support scalp health and give hair its shine. On the other hand, a lack of these nutrients can result in dry scalp and dull hair. Omega-3 fatty acids also help promote the health of your skin.

**Supporting bone health**

Your bones rely on nutrients like vitamin D and calcium to stay healthy, and salmon is an excellent source of both. Because your body can’t make its own calcium, you need to get it from the foods you eat. You also need vitamin D in order to absorb it.

Experts recommend all adults eat at least two portions (a total of 8 ounces) of seafood a week, especially fish that are high in omega-3s like salmon. The FDA and the EPA both suggest that children eat one or two servings (about 2 to 4 ounces) of seafood a week starting at age at age 1. Serving sizes range between 1-4 ounces depending on age and only from lower-mercury sources.  People who are pregnant and young children should [avoid fish with the most mercury](https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/eating-fish-what-pregnant-women-and-parents-should-know). Luckily, salmon is not one of them.

**Omega-3 fatty acids**

One of the top health benefits of eating salmon, either raw or cooked, is that it is high in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids help the body in several ways, including:

- Improved brain function
- Decreased risk of cardiovascular problems, like [heart attack](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-disease-heart-attacks) and heart arrhythmia
- Reduced risk of stroke and high blood pressure
- Improved cell function
- Improved control of the body’s inflammatory processes
- Joint protection
- Improved mood

Most omega-3s are "essential" fatty acids. Your body can’t make them, but they play critical roles in your body. They can lower the chance that you’ll have:

- Some types of cancer
- [Dementia](https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/alzheimers-dementia)
- [Alzheimer's](https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/default.htm) and other cognitive diseases

They can also ease the effects of [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-basics).

**Protein**

Salmon is a great source of the proteins your body needs to build muscles, bone, and cartilage. This protein helps maintain muscle mass while you lose weight, in addition to keeping a healthy metabolic rate and bone density.

**Antioxidants**

There are several varieties of salmon, but they are all known for their pinkish-orange color. This color comes from a compound called astaxanthin, an antioxidant. It helps to prevent several diseases, including neurodegenerative (loss of brain function), [cardiovascular](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/diseases-cardiovascular), and inflammatory diseases.

## Salmon Risks

Although it offers many health benefits, there are some health risks of eating salmon, especially in large amounts. In some cases, it can cause:

**Bleeding problems.** For all of the health benefits of omega-3s, high doses of them, like in supplements, can cause bleeding problems if you take some anticoagulant drugs. So make sure you stay within the guidelines above. Fish oil is a natural anticoagulant, which means that it acts as a [blood thinner](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/dvt-treatment-tips-for-taking-heparin-and-warfarin-safely). High doses (more than 3 grams a day) of omega-3 fatty acids can cause bleeding problems if taken with medications to prevent blood clots.

**Disease.** Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity, as well as other diseases. One kind of POP -- polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs -- can be found in salmon. However, its levels are five to 10 times higher in farmed fish than in wild fish.

**Cancer.** Eating large amounts of salmon and other fish could expose you to cancer-causing chemicals, or carcinogens. Fish get these chemicals by swimming in polluted water. Although both wild and farmed salmon carry this risk, the benefit-risk ratio for wild salmon is significantly greater.

**Nervous system damage.** All fish contain some amount of mercury, salmon included. While high levels of mercury are not an issue for most people, they can cause damage to a developing fetus as well as the [nervous system](https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-nervous-system) in young children.

## What Are Salmon Eggs?

Salmon roe are the developed eggs of salmon. Salmon eggs are red-orange in color and are taken from the inside of the fish. Eating fish roe provides many of the same healthy vitamins and minerals as eating fish meat.

Fish roe, research shows, may help with improving or preventing the following health conditions:

- [Depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/understanding-depression-basics)
- Inflammation
- Heart disease
- Rheumatoid Arthritis

**Salmon egg nutrition**

One serving of raw fish roe (1 tablespoon) has the following nutrients on average:

- Calories: 20
- Protein: 3 grams
- Fat: 1 gram
- Carbohydrates: 0 grams
- [Fiber](https://www.webmd.com/diet/compare-dietary-fibers): 0 grams
- Sugars: 0 grams

Salmon eggs are a good source of:

- Potassium
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin B12
- Vitamin C

## How to Eat Salmon

Fish shouldn't smell "fishy" but fresh and mild. Only buy fish that’s refrigerated or displayed on a big bed of ice. Frozen seafood should be solid, not leaking or squishy.

When preparing your salmon, keep everything clean. That includes your hands, cutting boards, and utensils. That way, bacteria won’t spread from your fish to other foods.

If your salmon is frozen, thaw it gradually in the refrigerator overnight. If you need it quickly, you can thaw it in cold water in a leak-proof bag. You can also do it in the microwave, but you should cook it immediately after.

And never leave any seafood -- or other perishable foods -- at room temperature for more than 2 hours.

You should cook your salmon to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F until the flesh is opaque and separates easily with a fork. You can eat it raw, but make sure you freeze it first to kill any parasites. Germs can pop up in raw fish, though, which is why experts say you should broil, grill, poach, or bake it.

You can fry it, too, but frying isn't always the best choice for your health. What's more, frying your salmon also can seal in pollutants already in the [fish](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-fish).

If you must fry it, do it at home in a tablespoon of olive oil. That way, most of the fats you get are the healthy, unsaturated kind. You also don't get any of the unhealthy trans fat.

**Salmon patties (croquettes)**

These are a great choice for appetizers, salad additions, or as a burger alternative.

You'll combine  [yogurt](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-yogurt), garlic, salt, pepper, dill, and cucumber. Put the mixture in your fridge until it's ready to serve.

Add cottage cheese, dill, lemon pepper, and scallions to whisked eggs. Then, drain salmon and add that as well. Sprinkle in breadcrumbs and mix it altogether well.

Form the mixture into four patties (each at 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch thick and 3 inches across).

Fry these patties over medium-high heat in light oil for 2 or 3 minutes per side. Make sure the outsides are golden and crispy while the inside is moist. Serve these with the yogurt dill sauce.

**Salmon sashimi**

Sashimi is raw fish or [shellfish](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-of-shellfish) that's served sliced or as finger-sized pieces over a rice ball, or sushi. Sashimi can come in many forms, including raw salmon.

## How to Cook Salmon

You can cook salmon in many different ways. Some of the most popular include:

**Baked salmon.** Bake your salmon in the oven at 400 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes, based on how thick the pieces are. Place your pieces, set on aluminum foil, on a baking sheet. For extra flavor, season them before you bake them.

**Air fryer salmon.** An air fryer can be a great alternative to fried fish. It doesn't require added oils, so you can enjoy your fried salmon without the added fats.

**Grilled salmon.** You can wrap salmon in aluminum foil and grill it until it's firm and not clear-ish anymore. It tends to take 10 minutes on each side to cook. You can serve it with [rice](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-rice), veggies, or a salad.

## How to Eat Raw Salmon

Eating raw salmon is popular in many countries all over the world. In Japan, sushi and sashimi are traditional dishes that feature a variety of raw fish, including salmon.

In Hawaii, eating raw salmon is common in the form of poké. This is a salad that features raw fish, vegetables, and sometimes ingredients like rice or fruit. Singapore also has a salad dish called yu sheng that features raw salmon.

Other cultures use raw salmon to prepare foods like ceviche or [smoked salmon](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-smoked-salmon). Smoked salmon is not cooked but rather cured using smoke. Like other forms of raw salmon, the USDA says it’s safe to eat when kept refrigerated and vacuum-sealed.

**Is raw salmon safe?**

While eating raw salmon is quite common, there are risks with eating any kind of raw fish or seafood.

**Parasites.** Some kinds of raw fish, including salmon, contain parasites that can make you sick. These parasites are normally destroyed by heat when cooking but can also be eliminated by freezing the fish if you intend to eat salmon raw. However, one of the risks of eating sushi or raw fish in restaurants is that there is no regulation in the U.S. to make sure that chefs flash-freeze fish before preparing it.‌

**Questionably graded fish.** When buying raw fish to prepare at home, many people seek out sushi-grade fish. This name is used to give the consumer an idea of the freshness or quality of the fish.

But there are currently no regulations in the U.S. on the use of the term “sushi-grade.” This means that any raw fish can technically be labeled as sushi-grade. Many stores use this term to describe their freshest fish available.

**Bacteria.** Another of the risks of eating raw salmon is bacteria. Two common kinds of food poisoning that people can experience from eating raw fish are salmonella and _Vibrio vulnificus_. While salmonella is more common, _Vibrio vulnificus_ is a type of bacteria that lives in warm saltwater.

**Cross-contamination.** Eating raw salmon or seafood may not be safe due to cross-contamination. This can happen when even high-quality fish come into contact with an object like a knife or plate that has germs on it.

At a restaurant, cross-contamination can also happen if a chef uses a cooking utensil or gloves that have come into contact with other raw ingredients.

**Special concerns**

There are some things you should think about when eating raw salmon. For certain people, it is not safe to eat raw salmon at all. This includes:

- Pregnant people
- People with compromised [immune systems](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function)
- Young children
- Older people
- People taking immune-suppressing medications

## What Is Subchondral Sclerosis?

Subchondral sclerosis is a thickening of bone that happens in joints affected by [osteoarthritis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/default.htm). If you’ve been diagnosed with osteoarthritis or have early [symptoms of osteoarthritis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/osteoarthritis-symptoms), your doctor may mention subchondral sclerosis as one sign of the disease.

“Subchondral bone” is bone that sits underneath cartilage in a [joint](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/joint-pain). Subchondral bone is found in large joints like the knees and hips, as well as in small joints like those of the hands and feet.

“Sclerosis” refers to an unusual increase in the density or hardness of a tissue in the body. In the case of bone, sclerosis means that an area of bone is making more new bone tissue than usual and becoming denser and thicker. So subchondral sclerosis is a thickening and hardening of bone that happens underneath cartilage in a joint.

## When Subchondral Sclerosis Occurs

While bone sclerosis in general can be related to other conditions, sclerosis of the subchondral bone in joints is linked to osteoarthritis.

Some studies show that subchondral sclerosis can happen before osteoarthritis damages joint cartilage. This raises the question of whether subchondral sclerosis actually causes, in part, the disease. Researchers are studying this, and some have found that subchondral sclerosis is more common in later stages of osteoarthritis.

Doctors can diagnose osteoarthritis without any signs of subchondral sclerosis. But when it’s present, the thickening of bone can help them diagnose osteoarthritis. Other conditions that have similar symptoms to osteoarthritis, such as [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-basics), don’t lead to subchrondral sclerosis.

## Symptoms of Subchondral Sclerosis

The symptoms of subchondral sclerosis are similar to the most common ones from osteoarthritis, such as:

- [Pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm) and tenderness in affected joints -- most often the hands, knees, hips, and [spine](https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/cm/rm-quiz-spine-quiz)
- Stiffness and loss of flexibility in joints
- A grating feeling in the joint
- Hard lumps, or [bone spurs](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-are-bone-spurs), in the bones around the affected joints

## Diagnosing Subchondral Sclerosis

The changes in bone linked to subchondral sclerosis show up on [MRI](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-an-mri) and X-ray scans. The subchondral sclerosis appears as a bright, dense area of bone on the scans.

## Subchondral Sclerosis Treatments

There are no treatments specifically for subchondral sclerosis, but there are for osteoarthritis.

Some surgical treatments for advanced osteoarthritis, including joint replacement surgery or an osteotomy in which an area of bone is removed, may lead to the removal of bone affected by subchondral sclerosis.

## What Is Postnasal Drip?

Postnasal drip is the drainage of mucus from your nose or sinuses into your pharynx, or throat.

Every day, glands in the linings of your nose, throat, airways, [stomach](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/abdominal-pain-causes-treatments), and intestinal tract produce mucus. Your nose alone makes about a quart of it each day. Mucus is a thick, wet substance that moistens these areas and helps trap and destroy foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses before they cause infection.

Normally, you don't notice the mucus from your nose because it mixes with [saliva](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/what-is-saliva), drips harmlessly down the back of your throat, and you swallow it.

When your body produces more mucus than usual or it's thicker than normal, it becomes more noticeable.

The excess can come out of the nostrils -- that's a runny nose. When the mucus runs down the back of your nose to your throat, it's called postnasal drip.

This feeling that something is dripping down your throat is a common symptom of conditions such as the common cold, sinusitis, and allergies. It can cause a sore throat or a cough.

Inflammation or swelling of the nasal passages can cause postnasal drip to build up. When that happens, the excess mucus, or [snot](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/video/myths-and-facts-about-snot), can also cause congestion. Common reasons for nasal inflammation include viral or bacterial infections, allergies, or irritants in the air.

When you're not feeling well, it's common to get postnasal drip. It can feel gross and uncomfortable. In some cases, postnasal drip may turn into a chronic cough or ongoing problem.

## Mucus Colors Meaning

Mucus is mostly water, antibodies, proteins, and dissolved salts. It's your body's way of trapping dust, dirt, and other particles from entering your lungs. Color changes to your mucus may mean something is going on with your health.

It's more common to get thick, colored mucus at the beginning of a bacterial infection. And other symptoms caused by a bacterial infection often last more than 10 days without getting better. With a viral infection, it's more common to get thick, colored mucus later, after several days.

**Clear mucus**

Normal mucus is clear. It means that your nasal passages are healthy.

In the beginning stages of a cold or allergy, you may still have clear mucus, just more of it. That extra mucus is the sign that the body is fighting off an infection or irritation.

**White mucus**

White or cloudy mucus is often thicker. This happens because your nasal passages become swollen or inflamed, which causes your mucus to lose moisture. White or cloudy mucus may mean you have a cold or nasal infection.

**Yellow mucus**

Yellow mucus can mean your cold or nasal infection is getting worse. Both bacterial and viral upper [respiratory infections](https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/keep-getting-infections) can cause yellow mucus. The color comes from white blood cells that rush to the infection to try to clear it.

An increase in the number of certain immune system cells or in the enzymes these cells produce can cause your mucus to change to yellow or green.

**Green mucus**

Green mucus can be a sign of a more serious viral or bacterial infection. It means your immune system is working hard to fight off the infection. Green mucus is thick with dead [white blood cells](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/white-blood-cell-count-low).

If you still feel sick after 10 days or if you have a fever, see your doctor right away. Green mucus can mean you have sinusitis. You will need to take antibiotics to treat this bacterial infection.

**Brown mucus**

Brown mucus can be a sign of exposure to pollution or smoking. It can also be caused by a bacterial infection or the presence of dried blood, which can occur from blowing your nose too hard. If your mucus is brown and you have other symptoms, see a doctor right away to rule out any serious conditions.

Heavy smokers and people with certain lung diseases are more likely to have brown or black mucus.

**Black mucus**

Black mucus isn't a common color and can be a sign of exposure to very high levels of pollution or smoke. The debris can build up in your nose.

In rare cases, black mucus can mean you have a serious [fungal infection](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/fungal-infections-skin). These infections are more common in people with compromised immune systems.

If you have other symptoms or have a compromised immune system, see your doctor right away to rule out any serious issues.

**Pink or red mucus**

Pink or red mucus can be a sign of bleeding in the nasal passages. Blowing or rubbing your nose too hard can cause some blood vessels to break. You may see a pinkish hue. In some cases, you may get a nosebleed. An infection can also cause your nose to bleed. If the red color is accompanied by other symptoms, see a doctor right away for treatment.

## What Causes Postnasal Drip?

The excess mucus that triggers it has many possible causes, including:

- Flu
- Allergies, also called allergic postnasal drip
- Sinus infection or sinusitis, which is an inflammation of the [sinuses](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinus-tips)
- Object stuck in the nose (most common in children)
- Certain medications, including some for birth control and blood pressure
- [Deviated septum](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/deviated-septum), which is the crooked placement of the wall that separates your two nostrils, or some other problem with the structure of the nose that affects the sinuses
- Changing weather, cold temperatures, or really dry air
- Certain foods (for example, spicy foods may trigger mucus flow)
- Pregnancy
- Sensitivity to bright lights
- Fumes from chemicals, perfumes, cleaning products, smoke, or other irritants

Sometimes the problem isn't that you're producing too much mucus, but that it's not being cleared away. Swallowing problems can cause a buildup of liquids in the throat, which can feel like postnasal drip. These problems can sometimes occur because of a blockage or conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as [GERD](https://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/reflux-disease-gerd-1).

## Postnasal Drip Symptoms

Postnasal drip can be a small annoyance at first. Your throat may feel scratchy. Too much mucus can also make your voice sound hoarse, or like you are gurgling. You may have an urge to constantly clear your throat. A buildup of mucus can also cause bad breath.

Over time, postnasal drip can cause a sore or irritated throat. It can lead to inflammation, which can cause your tonsils and other tissues in your throat to swell.

It also can trigger a cough, which often gets worse at night. In fact, postnasal drip is one of the most common causes of a cough that just won't go away.

If the mucus plugs up your Eustachian tube, which connects your throat to your middle ear, you could get a painful ear infection. You could also get a [sinus infection](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinusitis-and-sinus-infection) if those passages are clogged.

**Postnasal drip and nausea**

Nausea isn't a typical symptom of postnasal drip. But if too much mucus drains into your stomach, it can cause nausea or vomiting.

Some people may also have nausea when taking certain medications used to treat postnasal drip symptoms such as decongestants. These medications can cause stomach upset and may lead to nausea in some individuals. If you're experiencing nausea while taking these medications, talk to your doctor about alternative treatment options.

## Postnasal Drip Diagnosis

To figure out what's causing your postnasal drip, your doctor will:

- Ask about your medical history, including symptoms with your postnasal drip
- Do a physical exam of your ear, nose, and throat.

Your doctor may refer you to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor, called an otolaryngologist. The ENT doctor may recommend a nasal endoscopy. This procedure looks inside your nasal cavity and the openings of your sinuses using a special device called an endoscope -- a thin flexible tube with a camera and a light. They may also order imaging tests such as X-rays.

If your doctor thinks allergies are causing your postnasal drip, they may refer you to an allergy doctor for testing and treatment.

## Postnasal Drip Treatments

How you treat postnasal drip depends on what's causing it.

**Over-the-counter medications**

Antihistamines and [decongestants](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants) can often help with postnasal drip caused by sinusitis and viral infections. They also can be effective, along with steroid nasal sprays, for postnasal drip caused by allergies.

The older, over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines, including [diphenhydramine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1428/diphenhydramine-oral/details) ( [Benadryl](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5680/benadryl-oral/details)) and [chlorpheniramine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-53948/chlorpheniramine-allergy-oral/details) (Chlor-Trimeton), might not be the best choices for postnasal drip. When they dry out mucus, they can actually thicken it. They also may make you drowsy.

Newer [antihistamines](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/video/video-decongestants-vs-antihistamines) may be better options and are less likely to cause drowsiness. They include:

- [Cetirizine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-12065/cetirizine-oral/details) ( [Zyrtec](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/search?type=drugs&query=zyrtec))
- Desloratadine ( [Clarinex](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-22326/clarinex-oral/details))
- Fexofenadine ( [Allegra](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-13821-2204/allegra-oral/fexofenadine-oral/details))
- [Levocetirizine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-148989/levocetirizine-oral/details) ( [Xyzal](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-148996/xyzal-oral/details))
- [Loratadine](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-73-204/loratadine-oral/loratadine-oral/details) ( [Claritin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5346/claritin-oral/details), [Alavert](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-64728-204/alavert-oral/loratadine-oral/details))

It's a good idea to check with your doctor before taking these because all of them can have side effects that range from dizziness to [dry mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/dental-health-dry-mouth).

Oral [decongestants](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants), such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), can shrink swollen blood vessels and tissues in your nasal and sinus passages. This can help unblock a stuffy nose and cause fewer postnasal drips.

OTC corticosteroid nasal sprays can also help. They include:

- Fluticasone (Flonase)
- [Triamcinolone](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-9/triamcinolone-acetonide-injection/details) ( [Nasacort](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16244/nasacort-aq-nasal/details))

Nasal spray decongestants containing [oxymetazoline](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-20236/oxymetazoline-menthol-nasal/details) (Afrin or Vicks Sinex) can often stop postnasal drip more quickly. But these should be taken for no more than a couple of days. Anything longer than that can create a rebound effect, making your congestion worse.

**Prescription medication**

If OTC medications don't help, you may need a prescription medication. If postnasal drip is caused by a [bacterial infection](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/bacterial-and-viral-infections), antibiotics can help clear up the infection and stop the drip.

Antibiotics don't work on colds and other [viral infections](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/bacterial-and-viral-infections).

Prescription medications for postnasal drip may include nasal sprays like beclomethasone and ipratropium (Atrovent).

**Deviated septum surgery**

In cases where a [deviated septum](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/deviated-septum) causes postnasal drip, surgery to straighten your septum, called a [septoplasty](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/surgery-deviated-septum), leads to better airflow. It's a more permanent solution to postnasal drip.

**Other methods**

Postnasal drip can also cause mucus buildup. To thin out your mucus, you can use saline or medicated nasal sprays. You can also take a mucus-thinning medication such as guaifenesin (Mucinex).

## Postnasal Drip Home Remedies

For centuries, people have treated postnasal drip with all kinds of home remedies. Probably the best known and most loved is hot chicken soup.

While it won't cure you, hot soup or any hot liquid might give you some temporary relief and comfort. It works because the steam from the hot liquid opens up your stuffy nose and throat. It also thins out mucus. And because it's a fluid, the hot soup will help prevent [dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/video/healthy-soup-tips), which will make you feel better, too.

Because postnasal drip can cause thick mucus, keeping it thin can help relieve symptoms. Thick mucus is stickier and more likely to bother you. Keeping mucus thin helps prevent blockages in the ears and sinuses. A simple way to thin it out is to drink more water.

**Other home remedies**

To manage postnasal drip and the thick mucus it causes:

- Take a hot, steamy shower.
- Prop up your pillows at night so that the mucus doesn't pool or collect in the back of your throat.
- Use a nasal irrigation, such as a neti pot, to flush mucus, bacteria, allergens, and other irritating things out of the sinuses.
- Use a vaporizer or humidifier to add moisture in the air.

## Postnasal Drip Prevention

Postnasal drip is a common symptom of many respiratory and cold viruses. But with more than 200 cold viruses, it can prove difficult to prevent catching a cold. Viruses can spread through the air and can linger on surfaces that you touch every day. But there are some things you can do to lower your risk of getting sick, or developing postnasal drip.

**Wash your hands**

To prevent the spread of germs, wash your hands before and after:

- Preparing food
- Eating food
- Caring for someone who is sick, especially with vomiting or diarrhea
- Treating a cut or wound

Also wash your hands after:

- Blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If possible, cough or sneeze into your elbow, to help prevent the spread of germs to others.
- Using the toilet
- Changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the toilet
- Handling pet food/treats and pet waste
- Touching garbage
- Touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste

**Get vaccinated**

Get recommended vaccines, such as the flu and COVID-19 vaccines, to help prevent you from getting sick with a virus in the first place.

**Prevent allergies**

If you have allergies, you can take OTC allergy medication before spring allergy season to help prevent postnasal drip.

[Cromolyn](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16794/cromolyn-nasal/details)(Nasalcrom) is an OTC nasal spray that helps prevent allergy symptoms in your nose. It reduces runny nose and postnasal drip. Cromolyn isn't an antihistamine, so it doesn't provide immediate relief of symptoms. It takes 1 to 2 weeks to work and for best results should be taken before allergy season starts.

Your doctor may also recommend immunotherapy, or [allergy shots](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/video/video-allergy-testing-and-shots), to prevent allergy symptoms before they start.

You can also prevent seasonal and other allergies, including indoor allergens, by reducing your triggers:

- Cover your mattresses and pillowcases with dust-mite-proof covers.
- Wash all sheets, pillowcases, and mattress covers often in hot water.
- Use special HEPA air filters in your home. These can remove very fine particles from the air.
- Dust and vacuum regularly.

## Postnasal Drip Outlook

Most people experience postnasal drip at some point. It's a common symptom of colds, allergies, and infections. Most of the time, you can treat postnasal drip with OTC medications and at-home remedies. If you keep getting postnasal drip, or it doesn't go away and you have other symptoms, see your doctor to find out the cause and best way to treat it.

## When to See the Doctor

Call your doctor if:

- Your postnasal drip smells bad.
- You have a fever.
- You start wheezing.
- Your symptoms are severe or last for 10 days or more.

These may be signs that you have a bacterial infection. And let your doctor know right away if you notice blood in your postnasal drip.

If medication doesn't relieve your symptoms, you might need to see an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist (also called an otolaryngologist) for evaluation. Your doctor might want you to get a [CT scan](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-is-a-ct-scan), X-rays, or other tests.

## Takeaways

Postnasal drip is a common symptom of allergies, nasal irritants, and bacterial and viral infections that causes your nose to increase mucus production. The excess mucus then drips down the back of your throat. Postnasal drip causes other symptoms, including a sore throat, hoarse voice, lingering cough, and bad breath. If your postnasal drip gets worse, doesn't get better after 10 days, or you have a fever with it, see your doctor. They can help figure out what's causing it and how best to treat it.

## Postnasal Drip FAQs

**What does postnasal drip feel like?**

Your nose makes about a quart of mucus every day. Most of the time, you don't feel it because it mixes with saliva and you swallow it unnoticed. But when you have a nasal irritant or infection, your nose can produce more and thicker mucus. Postnasal drip feels like liquid dripping in the back of your throat. As the mucus builds up, it can make you feel congested or stuffed up. It can also feel like a sore, scratchy, or tickly throat.

**What is the best over-the-counter medicine for postnasal drip?**

There are several types of OTC medicines that can treat postnasal drip. But what works best will depend on what's causing your postnasal drip. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you choose one that's right for you and your symptoms.

**What allergies cause postnasal drip?**

Any allergy or irritant to your nose can cause a runny nose and increase postnasal drip. Examples are dust allergies or seasonal pollen allergies.

**Why won't the mucus in my throat go away?**

Mucus buildup can become thick, so it may take time to clear up. To help thin out thickened mucus, try using medicated or saline nasal sprays. An irrigation device called a neti pot can also flush out thick mucus. A hot steam shower can also help moisten your nasal passages and relieve congestion. You can take medication called guaifenesin (Mucinex) to thin out mucus. Sometimes when mucus builds up it can cause a bacterial infection, and you'll need antibiotics to help clear it up.

**Does Flonase help with postnasal drip?**

Flonase is an OTC steroid nasal spray that treats sneezing, itchy, or runny nose caused by seasonal allergies. It can help stop a runny nose and postnasal drip.

## What Is Hyperglycemia?

Hyperglycemia (also called high blood sugar or high blood glucose) is when there's too much glucose (sugar) in your bloodstream, typically because your body isn't making or using insulin as well as it should. Insulin is a hormone that helps balance out your blood sugar levels.

Around 1 in 10 people in the United States have diabetes. Blood sugar control is at the center of any diabetes treatment plan. Hyperglycemia is a major concern, and can affect people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. There are two main kinds:

- **Fasting** **hyperglycemia**. This is blood sugar for people who have diabetes that's higher than 130 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) after not eating or drinking for at least 8 hours. If your fasting blood glucose is 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL, this means you have prediabetes.
- **Postprandial or after-meal hyperglycemia**. This is blood sugar that's higher than 180 mg/dL 2 hours after you eat. People without diabetes rarely have blood sugar levels over 140 mg/dL after a meal, unless it’s really large.

When it happens often or all the time, high glucose levels can cause damage to your nerves, blood vessels, and organs. It can also lead to other serious conditions.

It's important to treat high blood sugar right away to help avoid more health problems.

**Hyperglycemia vs. Hypoglycemia**

These conditions are related to blood sugar, but they're very different. Hyperglycemia is when your blood sugar spikes too high, while hypoglycemia means your blood sugar level is lower than normal.

## What Causes High Blood Sugar?

As your body breaks down the food you eat, it turns carbs into a type of sugar called glucose, which gives you energy. Glucose goes into your bloodstream after you eat, but it needs insulin, a hormone from the pancreas, to get into your body's cells so they can use it. When your blood sugar rises, your pancreas releases insulin, letting glucose into cells. Your liver and muscles store extra glucose, which keeps your blood sugar levels normal. Diabetes interrupts this process. In type 2 diabetes, your body resists insulin or doesn't make enough of it, so sugar stays in your blood.

When you have diabetes, your blood sugar may rise if you:

- Skip or forget your [insulin](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/insulin-explained) or oral glucose-lowering medicine
- Eat too many grams of carbohydrates for the amount of insulin you took, or eat too many carbs in general
- Have an infection
- Are sick
- Are under stress
- Become inactive or exercise less than usual
- Take part in strenuous physical activity, especially when your blood sugar levels are high and insulin levels are low

**Insulin resistance**

A major reason why you may have hyperglycemia is insulin resistance. It's also the leading cause of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance happens when your muscle, fat, and liver cells react abnormally to insulin. As a result, your body needs higher amounts of insulin to balance out your blood sugar levels. If your body doesn't get the insulin it needs, you'll end up with hyperglycemia.

Here are some reasons why you could have insulin resistance:

- [Obesity](https://www.webmd.com/obesity/what-obesity-is)(especially extra weight around your belly and organs)
- Lack of exercise
- Eating high-processed, high-carbohydrate foods and saturated fats
- Medicines such as corticosteroids and some blood pressure, HIV, and mental health treatments

**The dawn phenomenon**

Another possible reason for a spike in your blood sugar is what's called the dawn phenomenon. This is when your blood sugar rises in the morning, usually between 4 and 8 a.m. Researchers aren't sure what causes the dawn phenomenon. But they think when your body releases certain hormones (growth hormone, cortisol, and others) overnight, it boosts insulin resistance and raises your blood sugar.

Causes of high blood sugar in the morning include:

- A lack of insulin the previous night
- An incorrect dose of diabetes medicine the night before
- Eating carbs before bedtime

**Hyperglycemia in people without diabetes**

People without diabetes can also have high blood sugar. Causes include:

- **Cushing's syndrome.** This rare condition happens when your cortisol hormone levels stay raised for too long. One symptom of the disease is high blood sugar.
- **Diseases of the pancreas.** One job of your pancreas is to make insulin and [glucagon](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/glucagon-blood-sugar) and transport these hormones into your bloodstream. When a disease like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer disrupts this process, it can cause high blood sugar.
- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).** This condition results from your ovaries making too much of sex hormones called androgens. Experts aren't sure what causes PCOS, but they do know many people with the condition have insulin resistance.

## Symptoms of High Blood Sugar

Early hyperglycemia symptoms include:

- Thirst
- Headaches
- Trouble concentrating
- Blurred vision
- Frequent peeing
- Fatigue (weak, tired feeling)
- Weight loss
- Blood sugar more than 180 mg/dL

Ongoing high blood sugar may cause:

- Vaginal and skin infections
- Slow-healing cuts and sores
- Worse vision
- Nerve damage [,](https://www.webmd.com/brain/nerve-pain-and-nerve-damage-symptoms-and-causes) causing painful, cold, or insensitive feet; loss of hair on the lower extremities; or erectile dysfunction
- Stomach and intestinal problems such as chronic constipation or diarrhea
- Damage to your eyes, blood vessels, or kidneys

**Diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA)**

If hyperglycemia symptoms become too serious, you could form another life-threatening health problem called [diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA)](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/ketoacidosis). When you can't process glucose, your liver makes chemicals called ketones for your body to use for fuel. A lack of insulin coupled with too many ketones causes your blood to turn acidic.

DKA tends to happen in people with diabetes who take insulin or those with type 1 diabetes but haven't been diagnosed. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include:

- Feeling sick to your stomach and throwing up
- A loss of too much body fluid (dehydration)
- Stomach pain
- Fruity-smelling breath
- Trouble breathing
- Your heart beats too fast
- Confusion
- You faint or black out

DKA is an emergency and can trigger a coma or death. Go to a hospital right away if you notice any symptoms.

## Hyperglycemia Risk Factors

You're more likely to have hyperglycemia if you:

- Don't take enough insulin or other diabetes medicines
- Don't inject insulin the right way or use expired insulin
- Don't stick with your [diabetes food plan](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-meal-plan)
- Don't stay active
- Are sick or have an infection
- Take medicines like steroids or those that keep your immune system in check
- Are injured or have had surgery
- Are stressed

Talk to your doctor about whether you should take more diabetes medicine than normal when you're ill or dealing with stress.

## Hyperglycemia Treatment

If you have diabetes and notice any of the early signs of high blood sugar, test your blood sugar and call the doctor. They may ask you for the results of several readings. They could recommend the following changes:

**Drink more water.** Water helps remove extra sugar from your blood through urine, and it helps you avoid [dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults).

**Exercise more.** Working out can help lower your blood sugar. But under certain conditions, it can make blood sugar go even higher. Ask your doctor what kind of exercise is right for you.

**Caution:** If you have type 1 diabetes and your blood sugar is high, you need to check your urine for ketones. When you have ketones, do NOT exercise. If you have type 2 diabetes and your blood sugar is high, you must also be sure that you have no ketones in your urine and that you are well-hydrated. Then your doctor might give you the OK to exercise with caution as long as you feel up to it.

**Change your eating habits.** You may need to meet with a dietitian to change the amount and types of foods you eat.

**Switch medications.** Your doctor may change the amount, timing, or type of diabetes medications you take. Don’t make changes without talking to them first.

If you have type 1 diabetes and your blood sugar is more than 250 mg/dL, your doctor may want you to test your urine or blood for [ketones](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/ketones-and-their-tests).

Call your doctor if your blood sugar is running higher than your treatment goals.

## Hyperglycemia Prevention

If you work to keep your blood sugar under control – follow your meal plan, exercise program, and medicine schedule – you shouldn’t have to worry about hyperglycemia. You can also:

- Know your diet – count the total amounts of carbs in each meal and snack.
- Test your blood sugar regularly.
- Tell your doctor if you have repeated abnormal blood sugar readings.
- Wear medical identification to let people know you have diabetes in case of an emergency.

## Hyperglycemia Complications

Living with hyperglycemia can mean other health problems, some that mean you need help right away and others that you may live with for the rest of your life.

**Long-term health problems**

Untreated hyperglycemia can trigger other long-term health problems, such as:

- Diseases of the heart and blood vessels ( [cardiovascular disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/diseases-cardiovascular))
- Nerve damage (neuropathy)
- Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) or kidney failure
- Blood vessel damage in your eyes (diabetic retinopathy)
- Poor blood flow or damage to the nerves leading to your feet, causing possible skin infections, ulcers, and the loss of your feet (amputation)
- Issues with your bones and joints
- Infections of your teeth and gums

**Emergency health problems**

Some conditions caused by blood glucose levels that are too high need treatment right away:

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis.** This is when a lack of insulin, along with a high level of ketones, causes your blood to turn acidic.
- **Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.** When your body makes insulin, but it doesn't work the right way, you may get this condition. Your blood glucose levels will then rise higher than 600 mg/dL without ketoacidosis. A hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state can make you dangerously dehydrated.

Both conditions can cause you to go into a coma, and even lead to death if they aren't treated.

## Takeaways

[Blood sugar control](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-diet-exercise) is crucial in managing diabetes since high blood sugar can lead to health problems. Track your blood sugar, take insulin or other medicines as prescribed by your doctor, keep a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and exercise routinely to manage high blood sugar. If you notice symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk to your doctor about your diabetes management plan.

## Hyperglycemia FAQs

**What are symptoms of hyperglycemia?**

Symptoms of early hyperglycemia include:

- Feeling thirsty
- Headaches
- Trouble focusing
- Blurred vision
- Peeing a lot

**Does hyperglycemia turn into diabetes?**

If you have hyperglycemia, this typically means you have diabetes. You may have hyperglycemia episodes a lot if you live with diabetes.

## What Is a Star Fruit?

Star fruit, also known as carambola, is a tropical fruit that looks like a star when you slice it. Unripe star fruit is dark green, but its thin layer of skin turns glossy yellow as it ripens. Carambolas are oval-shaped and are usually 3 to 5 inches long.

It mainly grows in India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, but you can get it all over the world. Star fruit has many health benefits, but it can be dangerous if you have kidney disease.

**Star fruit tree**

Star fruit grows on the _Averrhoa carambola_ tree. The trees grow well in sunny and humid climates like those of Southeast Asia, South America, Australia, and certain parts of the U.S.

**Star fruit taste**

Ripe star fruit is fleshy, crunchy, and juicy, and has a sweet and slightly tart taste. Smaller star fruits are more tart than the larger fruits. Over-ripe carambolas may have a fermented flavor, or taste sour.

## Star Fruit Nutrition

Star fruit is low in [calories](https://www.webmd.com/diet/calories-chart) has a lot of vitamins and other nutrients, including the following:

- Fiber
- Protein
- Vitamin C
- Vitamin B5
- Folate
- Copper
- Potassium
- Magnesium

## Star Fruit Health Benefits

**Anti-inflammatory ability.** The high levels of [antioxidants](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-antioxidants) in this fruit make it a good anti-inflammatory that can help ease symptoms of psoriasis and dermatitis.

**Weight loss promotion.** The fiber in star fruit can boost your metabolism and help you feel full longer, so you may eat less. It's also a low-cal snack.

**Immunity-boosting ability.** Star fruit gives you a healthy dose of vitamin C, which helps your body make germ-fighting white blood cells for a strong immune system.

**Improved heart health.** The potassium in star fruit helps lower your blood pressure, which lowers your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Research shows it also may lower [cholesterol levels](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/understanding-numbers).

**Improved digestion.** The fiber in star fruit helps move waste through your digestive tract, relieving constipation, bloating, cramping, and diarrhea. **‌**

## Star Fruit Side Effects

Eating star fruit is dangerous if you have kidney disease.

Carambolas have many helpful nutrients, but they also contain a substance called caramboxin that is a neurotoxin. That means it can affect your [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-diseases) and cause problems in your nervous system. Another substance in star fruit, oxalate, can cause damage at high concentrations, leading to reduced kidney function. If your kidneys are healthy, they can process and pass toxins out of your body. But if you have kidney disease, the toxins stay in your body and can cause serious illness.

The symptoms of star fruit poisoning include:

- Hiccups
- Mental confusion
- [Seizures](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/understanding-seizures-basics)

It's even possible to die from it. If you have kidney disease, you should never eat star fruit.

**Star fruit drug interactions**

Like certain other fruits, star fruit can change the way some prescription drugs work in your body. Ask your doctor whether star fruit is safe to eat with your medications. Avoid eating star fruit if you take:

- Bosutinib
- Panobinostat
- Venetoclax

## Where to Buy Star Fruit

You can find star fruit at local grocery stores, usually year-round. In the U.S., the fruits are harvested twice a year in South Florida: from August to September and December through February.

## How to Eat Star Fruit

Star fruit tastes best when it's ripe. Here are some ways people enjoy star fruit around the world:

**Eat star fruit raw, on its own, or with other fruit**. Try pairing the fruit with [avocados](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/all-about-avocados), kiwis, mangoes, and bananas in a fruit salad.

**Cook it as part of a main dish.** Star fruit is used in many recipes, including Vietnamese sour soup (often with seafood) and Indian curries.

**Make a puree, jam, or pickle**. You can preserve star fruit so it can be kept in the fridge or freezer to enjoy later. In India, star fruit is used for certain chutneys.

**Create an edible garnish.** You can sauté star fruit slices for a second or two, and sprinkle with sugar to glaze. Pair this with fish and poultry dishes, or use it as a substitute for lemon or lime slices to garnish chilled beverages.

**Drink it.** Use a juicer to extract star fruit juice, or add chopped star fruit to your blender with other fruit for a [smoothie](https://www.webmd.com/diet/smoothies-good-for-you).

## How to Cut Star Fruit

To create "star" slices, do the following:

1. Clean a ripe star fruit with water, then place it on a cutting board.
2. Carefully run a sharp knife along each of the five ridges, removing and discarding the brown outer edge. You don't need to peel the rest of the skin.
3. Position the star fruit horizontally on the cutting board, then begin cutting crosswise to your desired thickness.
4. Remove seeds from each star slice before cooking or serving.

## How to Store Star Fruit

If you buy a green-ribbed star fruit, let it ripen at room temperature, occasionally turning it, until it turns yellow and its fragrant "perfume" develops. You're looking for a full floral-fruity aroma, which means the fruit is at its best taste.

You can store ripened carambolas at room temperature if you're going to serve them in a day or two. The ripe fruit will last a bit longer in the [refrigerator](https://www.webmd.com/diet/difference-between-frozen-fruit-and-fresh-fruit). You'll know star fruit is over-ripe when it gets a lot of brown spots.

## The Verdict

Star fruit is a delicious, nutritious fruit that is low in calories but packed with vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants.

People with [kidney problems](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information) or those who take prescription drugs should talk with their doctor before eating this fruit.

## What Is Joint Pain?

Joints form the connections between bones in places such as your knees, elbows, shoulders, and hips. They provide support and help you move. Any damage to the joints from disease or injury can interfere with your movement and cause [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm).

Joint pain can affect any part of your body, from your ankles and feet to your shoulders and hands. The most likely joints to have pain are the:

- [Knees](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/default.htm)
- [Hips](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hip-problems-age-12-and-older-topic-overview)
- Spine
- Hands and feet

Pain can affect one or more joints. Some people feel more joint pain in the morning, which improves when they get moving. Others have more pain after they’re active. Often, the pain comes with swelling and inflammation, stiffness, and loss of movement in the joint.

## Joint Pain Causes

Joint pain is extremely common, especially as you age. More than 53 million Americans have arthritis, and that’s only one possible cause of joint pain.

A wide range of conditions can lead to painful joints:

- Osteoarthritis — wear and tear of your joints that happens with age
- [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-basics) — an autoimmune disease that happens when your immune system attacks its own tissues
- [Bursitis](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/arthritis-bursitis) — inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs that help cushion your joints

**What causes joint pain all over the body?**

Arthritis can cause pain in multiple joints. Fibromyalgia is another chronic condition that causes pain and tender points throughout the body. Body-wide joint pain can also be a symptom of these conditions:

- Inflammatory forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis and Still's disease
- Lupus
- Lyme disease
- Infections such as rheumatic fever, COVID-19, or the flu
- Bone cancer
- Leukemia

**What causes multiple joint pain without swelling**?

Inflammatory forms of arthritis, injuries, and infections typically cause joint pain with swelling. If you have pain in many joints but no swelling, it could be from osteoarthritis. Another possible cause is joint hypermobility syndrome, which makes your joints more flexible than usual.

**Elbow joint pain causes**

Injuries, arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions are the most likely causes of elbow joint pain. If your elbow hurts, it might be from:

- A type of arthritis such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or gout
- A fracture, sprain, tendon tear, or other injury
- Tendinitis (inflammation in the band of tissue that connects your muscles and bones)
- Bursitis
- Lupus (an autoimmune disease)

**Why does COVID cause joint pain?**

A COVID infection can cause many types of symptoms, including joint pain. In one review of studies, about 2%-65% of people with COVID experienced joint pain 4-12 months after their infection. Researchers don’t know exactly why, but they say COVID inflammation might trigger joint pain.

Another possible reason is that COVID causes an autoimmune-type condition where the immune system attacks the joints. Some people have developed inflammatory arthritis after a COVID infection.

**Can menopause cause aching joints?**

By some estimates, more than half of women have joint pain during menopause. Researchers have long suspected that estrogen plays a role in autoimmune joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis because these conditions are much more common in people assigned female at birth than in those assigned male at birth. The theory is that when estrogen levels drop during menopause, it causes joint pain.

Some studies have found that low estrogen increases levels of inflammatory proteins that contribute to rheumatoid arthritis, but other studies haven’t shown the same results. Experts say that overall, there isn’t enough evidence to prove that a lack of estrogen causes joint pain.

**Does dehydration cause joint pain?**

Not drinking enough water and other fluids won’t cause joint pain. But water is an important part of synovial fluid, the lubricant that reduces friction in joints and helps them move smoothly. Fluid also makes tissues more flexible and elastic, which helps prevent joint injuries.

## Joint Pain Symptoms

How joint pain feels depends on the cause. The pain could be achy, stiff, sharp, or sore. Your joints may burn or throb. There could be a grating sensation when you move the affected joint.

Pain isn’t the only symptom that happens with joint injuries and disease. Along with pain, you might have:

- Swelling
- Stiffness
- Trouble bending or straightening the joint
- Numbness or weakness
- Warmth
- Loss of movement

**Joint pain and weakness**

Some of the same conditions that cause pain also weaken joints. Infections such as the flu or Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, a sprain or other injury, and rheumatoid arthritis can cause joint pain and weakness. People with joint hypermobility syndrome have pain, stiffness, and weakness in the joints.

**Joint pain and fever**

When these two symptoms happen together, here are some of the conditions that might be to blame:

- Infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus, staph, or tuberculosis
- Inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriatic arthritis, or Sjӧgren’s syndrome
- Reactive arthritis, which is joint pain from an infection
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Gout
- Thyroid disease

**Cracking sound in joints**

Though cracking in a joint might sound scary, usually it’s nothing to worry about. The most common cause is gas releasing from the joint as you move it. The sound could also result from ligaments and tendons moving across each other. As you get older, a few creaks and cracks are normal as the cushioning cartilage between your joints wears away and bones rub together.

## Common Joint Pain Locations

You can feel pain in any joint, including your knees, hips, shoulders, fingers, and toes. The pain may only be in one joint at a time, or in more than one joint.

**Hip joint pain**

This pain is centered in the joint where your thigh bone connects to your pelvis. Hip pain can be from arthritis, a fall or other injury, bursitis, or a problem with the structure of your hip.

Depending on what’s causing the pain, you might feel it inside your hip or closer to the surface. Sometimes hip pain radiates, meaning that it spreads to places such as your lower back. You might only feel hip pain when you walk, or at night when you lie on the sore joint.

**Finger joint pain**

Pain in the finger joints may be from arthritis, especially if you have swelling and stiffness too. Injuries to the finger, such as sprains, strains, and mallet finger are other common causes. The finger might feel stiff, sore, throbbing, or achy, depending on the cause.

**Knee joint pain**

Your knees support a lot of your weight. That’s why these joints are so easy to injure. The resulting pain can disrupt your daily activities. Depending on the cause, you might feel the pain deep inside or on the surface of your knee. The pain might only be on one side or in the back of your knee. Or you could feel it all over the joint.

Like other kinds of joint pain, knee pain can come and go. It may hurt worse in the morning because you’re stiff. Or it might be more painful at night, especially if you were on your feet a lot during the day.

**Shoulder joint pain**

In most cases of shoulder joint pain, the cause is:

- Tendon inflammation such as bursitis or tendinitis
- A tendon tear
- Arthritis
- Fracture

Along with pain, you may have swelling, stiffness, weakness, and reduced movement in your shoulder. These problems could make it hard to lift your arms to brush your hair or put on clothes. Arthritis can also cause a grinding, popping, or cracking sound in the joint. If your shoulder pain results from a fracture, the pain could be sharp and you may see bruises on the shoulder.

**Joint pain in the big toe**

Pain in your big toe is often from arthritis. Hallux rigidus is a type of arthritis that affects the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This joint is at the bottom of your big toe where it attaches to your foot. Hallux rigidus causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in your big toe. You’ll feel the pain on top of your toe or inside it. You might also have a bony bump on top of your toe. Walking or wearing ill-fitting shoes can make the pain worse.

Gout is another form of arthritis that affects your big toe. The pain may be intense when a gout attack starts, but it should lessen in about 12 hours. Joints affected by gout are often swollen, tender, red, warm, and hard to move.

**What is sternoclavicular joint pain?**

The sternoclavicular (SC) joint is part of your shoulder joint. It sits in the place where your collarbone and breastbone meet. Pain in this joint isn’t common. When it hurts, the pain is usually due to wear-and-tear arthritis or an injury such as a sprain, fracture, or dislocation. Injuries to this joint can happen if you’ve had a hard hit, such as from a car accident or a football tackle.

You’ll feel SC joint pain in the front of your chest just below your neck. Pain from an injury tends to be sharper and there may be bruises on your chest. Arthritis causes swelling, tenderness, and trouble moving the joint. With arthritis, you may also have pain in other joints.

## Joint Pain Diagnosis

If joint pain affects your daily activities, or if you have symptoms such as swelling, redness, warmth, and a fever with it, visit your doctor.

Your doctor will ask questions such as:

- Where do you feel the pain?
- What do you think might have caused it?
- When did it start?
- What does the pain feel like?
- What other symptoms do you have?

Then, your doctor will examine the joint to see if it hurts when you move or if you have a reduced range of motion. You may need X-rays or other imaging tests such as MRI or CT scans to look for damage in the bones and tissues of your joint. Your doctor may do a blood test or remove fluid from the joint to check for arthritis, infections, and other conditions that cause joint pain.

## Treatments for Joint Pain

Joint pain can range from mild to severe. Acute pain lasts only a few weeks, while chronic joint pain can last months or longer. Even short-term pain and swelling in the joints can have negative effects on your quality of life. Whatever the cause of joint pain, you can usually manage it with medication, physical therapy, or alternative treatments. Treatment options include:

**Joint pain medicine**

For moderate-to-severe joint pain with swelling, an over-the-counter or prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin, celecoxib (Celebrex), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or [naproxen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-5173-Naproxen+Oral.aspx?drugid=5173&drugname=Naproxen+Oral) (Aleve) can offer relief. NSAIDs can cause side effects, possibly increasing your risk for stomach ulcers and heart problems.

If you have mild pain without any swelling, [acetaminophen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-362-acetaminophen+oral.aspx) may help. Be careful when taking this medicine though, especially if you drink alcohol. High doses may cause liver damage. Check with your doctor before taking these medicines if you’ve had a kidney or liver problem or stomach ulcers.

Other drugs that may help relieve pain include:

- [Antidepressants](https://www.webmd.com/depression/depression-medications-antidepressants)
- Anti-seizure drugs
- Muscle relaxants

The CDC doesn’t recommend opioid medication for joint pain because of the potential for addiction and abuse. Opioid drugs also cause side effects such as drowsiness and [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-constipation). Non-opioid pain relievers such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, anti-seizure drugs, and antidepressants work better for joint pain. Opioids should only be a last resort when no other treatment has helped. Even then, your doctor should prescribe the lowest possible dose needed to control your pain.

**Joint pain relief cream**

Other medicines come as creams or gels that you rub onto the skin over painful joints. These include:

[**Capsaicin**](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-4181-capsaicin+top.aspx)**.** This substance from chili peppers blocks chemicals that transmit pain signals, creating a feeling of warmth on the skin. Side effects of capsaicin cream include burning or stinging in the area where you apply it.

**Topical NSAIDs.** These medicines work in the same way as NSAID pills, but they’re less likely to cause side effects such as stomach upset and heart problems.

**Salicylates.** Products like Aspercreme and Bengay contain methyl [salicylate](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/salicylate-allergy), a pain-relieving ingredient.

**Lidocaine.** Creams, gels, sprays, and patches containing the anesthetic lidocaine numb the painful area.

**Counterirritants.** Products such as Icy Hot and Biofreeze distract you from the pain by making your skin feel cold or warm.

**Joint pain injections**

If you don't find joint pain relief from oral or topical medications, your doctor may suggest injections such as:

**Corticosteroids.** The doctor can inject a steroid medication, sometimes combined with a local [anesthetic](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-general-anesthesia), directly into the joint once every 3 to 4 months. A steroid injection can ease pain for 1-3 months, but getting too many of these shots could further damage cartilage, ligaments, and tendons in the joint.

**Hyaluronic acid.** This substance replaces the natural fluid that lubricates your joints. Most people get one injection every 3-5 weeks. Hyaluronic acid injections ease pain and stiffness with fewer side effects than corticosteroids. This treatment works best for [osteoarthritis](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/default.htm).

[**Platelet-rich plasma**](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/platelet-rich-plasma-injections#1)**(PRP) therapy.** PRP is a substance your doctor makes by condensing plasma and proteins from your blood. These substances reduce the inflammation that causes joint pain and stiffness. They may also boost healing in the damaged joint. PRP might help with arthritis pain and stiffness for short periods, but doctors still don’t know its long-term effects. Plus, this treatment is very expensive and insurance doesn’t usually cover the cost.

**Prolotherapy.** In this treatment, the doctor injects an irritant such as a sugar solution into joints, ligaments, and tendons to stimulate healing. You may need 15-20 shots a month for 3 to 4 months. While prolotherapy may offer short-term relief from pain and stiffness, doctors don’t know its long-term effects.

**Autologous conditioned serum.** Like PRP, this serum comes from your own blood, which is concentrated to increase the amount of anti-inflammatory substances. Then your doctor injects the serum into your affected joint(s). Autologous conditioned serum seems to work best for easing moderate arthritis symptoms. It may not help with more severe joint damage.

**Joint aspiration**. Instead of adding fluid to your joint, this treatment removes excess fluid to relieve pressure and swelling. The knee is the most common site for aspiration, but doctors use it for other joints, too. Relieving pressure may help with pain and stiffness, too.

**Surgery**

Surgery could be an option if treatments such as medication, physical therapy, and injections haven’t helped or if you have an injury to the joint. These are some of the surgical techniques doctors use to relieve joint pain:

**Arthroscopy.** Your surgeon performs this procedure through very small incisions. Arthroscopic surgery can fix damaged cartilage and ligaments in the joint.

**Joint replacement or resurfacing.** In a total joint replacement, your surgeon removes the whole damaged joint and replaces it with moving parts made from metal, plastic, and/or ceramics. This procedure offers long-term relief from joint pain and stiffness. Joint resurfacing removes and replaces only part of the affected joint.

**Osteotomy.** During this procedure, the surgeon cuts the damaged bone and puts it into better alignment.

**Synovectomy.** This procedure removes inflamed parts of the synovium (the lining of the joint) that are damaging nearby cartilage. Surgeons perform synovectomy through either open surgery or arthroscopy. This procedure helps slow joint damage and ease pain and stiffness from arthritis, but the synovium can eventually grow back and cause symptoms again.

**Joint fusion.** This procedure fuses together severely damaged joints in the spine, ankle, wrist, or finger. The surgeon connects two or more bones with rods, pins, or plates. Over time, the bones fuse to hold the joint in place and make it more stable. Joint fusion surgery is a last resort when other treatments haven’t helped because it can severely restrict movement in the affected joint.

**Physical therapy**

A physical therapist can help you strengthen the muscles around the joint, stabilize the joint, and improve your range of motion. The therapist will teach you strength and flexibility exercises to do at home.

Physical therapy sessions also include techniques such as:

- [Ultrasound](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/doppler-ultrasound)
- Heat or cold therapy
- Electrical nerve stimulation
- Manipulation

Your physical therapist may also recommend assistive devices such as knee braces, shoe inserts, or a walker and show you how to use them.

**Alternative joint pain treatment**

Joint pain doesn’t always need treatment with medicine. Some natural therapies have also shown promise for easing discomfort. They include:

**Acupuncture.** In this form of traditional Chinese medicine, an acupuncturist inserts very thin needles into various pressure points around your body. Doing so stimulates blood flow and the release of natural painkillers. Research finds acupuncture helpful for knee osteoarthritis but not for hip osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

**Exercise.** Exercise is an effective way to [lose weight](https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm), which can ease pressure on painful joints. It also improves flexibility and range of motion in joints. Just be careful to stick to low-impact exercises that won't further irritate the joint. Swimming, bicycling, and tai chi are among the [best exercises](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm) because they [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-7-most-effective-exercises) your joints without putting too much pressure on them.

**How to treat postpartum joint pain**

Joint pain after you have a baby can happen because of hormone changes or from strain on the muscles due to pregnancy weight gain. You can manage postpartum joint pain with ibuprofen, and by holding a heating pad to sore joints.

## Joint Pain Home Remedies

You can ease short-term joint pain with a few simple techniques at home:

- Protect the joint with a brace or wrap.
- Rest the joint by avoiding any activities that cause you pain.
- Ice the joint for about 15 minutes, several times each day.
- Compress the joint using an elastic wrap.
- Raise the joint above the level of your heart.

Applying ice to your painful joints can ease pain and inflammation. For tight muscles around joints, try using a heating pad or wrap several times a day. Your doctor may recommend that you tape or splint the joint to minimize movement or reduce pain. Just avoid keeping the joint still for too long because it can become stiff and lose function.

**Joint pain supplements**

Glucosamine and chondroitin are components of the healthy cartilage, which normally cushions the bones and protects joints. Some research shows that [glucosamine](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-guide-glucosamine) and chondroitin [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/tc/dietary-supplements-topic-overview) can improve pain from knee, hip, and hand arthritis. These supplements come in capsule, tablet, powder, or liquid form.

Although glucosamine and chondroitin don’t work for everyone, they are safe to try because they don't have any major side effects. Even so, talk to your doctor before using these supplements if you have diabetes, you take a blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin), or you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Glucosamine and chondroitin can raise blood sugar and increase bleeding risk. Doctors don’t know how safe this supplement is for pregnant or nursing mothers.

## Living With Joint Pain

Making the following changes to your daily routine could help ease joint pain:

- Hold ice to the joint after an injury or to bring down swelling in the joint.
- To ease soreness and stiffness, try moist heat from a warm wet washcloth, heating pad, or warm shower or bath.
- Set aside a few minutes each day to gently stretch sore joints and move them through their range of motion. Ask a physical therapist or trainer which exercises are best for your type of pain.
- Use a brace or splint to take pressure off the painful joint.

**Supportive aids**

A few products you can buy at the drugstore, online, or through your doctor’s office can support your joints and help you move them more easily. These include:

- Braces
- Splints
- A cane or walker
- Orthotic shoe inserts

Your doctor or physical therapist can help you choose the right device and teach you how to use it.

## When to Call Your Doctor

Call your doctor if joint pain bothers you or interferes with your daily activities. Also, if you’ve tried pain relievers, exercise, and other at-home treatments and they haven’t helped, do call your doctor.

No matter what treatment you’re on, get medical help right away if:

- The pain becomes intense.
- Your joint suddenly looks inflamed or deformed.
- You can’t walk or use the joint at all.
- You have a fever or you’ve lost 10 pounds or more.

## Takeaways

Joint pain is very common, affecting millions of Americans. Arthritis, joint injuries, and bursitis are some of the most common causes. Often, you can manage joint pain at home with over-the-counter pain relievers, exercise, ice, and heat. But if these treatments don’t help and joint pain affects your daily life, see your doctor for treatment recommendations.

## Joint Pain FAQs

**What is the reason for joint pain?**

Often, joint pain is due to arthritis or an injury. Some infections and body-wide conditions, such as fibromyalgia or Lyme disease, also cause joint pain. Your doctor can examine you and do tests to find out what’s causing your pain.

**When should I worry about joint pain?**

Call your doctor if the affected joint is warm to the touch, you have a fever, or you can’t move the joint or walk.

**How can I reduce joint pain?**

You might start with conservative treatments such as NSAID pain relievers and physical therapy. If those therapies don’t work, your doctor might recommend joint injections. Surgery is usually the last option when other treatments haven’t helped.

**What deficiency causes joint pain?**

There may be a link between vitamin D deficiency and joint pain. Your body needs this vitamin to absorb calcium, keep your bones strong, and control inflammation. Experts recommend getting at least 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D daily from foods and supplements (if you need them).

## What Is a Saline Nasal Spray?

Saline nasal spray is a product containing a mixture of salt and water that you spray into your nose. (Saline means “containing salt.") You can use saline nasal spray to treat congestion and other symptoms caused by allergies. You can also use saline nasal spray to treat other conditions, such as nasal dryness and nosebleeds.

Saline nasal spray is available over the counter in a drug store or online. You can also make your own saline nasal solution at home and apply it to your nasal passages with a spray bottle.

## What Does Saline Nasal Spray Do?

If your nasal passages are dry, a good blast of saline nasal spray can make them feel more moist. When you’re congested, saline nasal spray clears out mucus and crusts in your nasal passages that are causing you to feel stuffed up. Using saline nasal spray or irrigation also helps cleanse your nasal passages, washing away pollen and other things that cause [allergy symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergy-symptoms). It may also help protect you from some types of infections.

## Types of Saline Nasal Sprays

You can buy an over-the-counter saline solution or make one at home.

Most over-the-counter saline nasal sprays are isotonic, which means the solution has the same saline concentration as found in your body. Hypertonic versions have a higher concentration of salt than what’s in your body. Both types can help clear mucus, though some studies show that hypertonic saline may do a better job of improving nasal symptoms. But they may also cause mild irritation and other side effects.

**Saline nasal spray for adults**

Some saline nasal spray options for adults include:

- Arm & Hammer Simply Saline Nasal Mist
- Ayr Saline Nasal Mist
- Xlear Nasal Spray
- Vicks Sinex Saline Nasal Spray

**Saline nasal spray for children**

If your child needs saline nasal spray, some choices include:

- Boogie Mist Baby Saline Nasal Spray
- Burt's Bees Kids Gentle Saline Spray and Drops
- NeilMed Pediamist Pediatric Saline
- Vicks Sinex Children's Saline Nasal Spray

## When Should I Use Saline Nasal Sprays?

Over-the-counter saline sprays and rinses can help remove pollen from the nasal lining. People often use them at the end of the day. You can also use these sprays to add moisture if your nose feels dry from winter weather.

If you use a nasal steroid spray to treat your allergies, doctors suggest you first use a saline spray to cleanse the nose and rid it of thick mucus and debris. Thick mucus can keep the steroid from working as well as possible.

## How Do I Make a Saline Solution?

Making your own saline solution is easy. Many people use this to do a saline sinus rinse. You can buy a small nasal spray bottle to store your saline solution.

To make the solution, mix 3 teaspoons of non-iodized salt (kosher salt with no additives is best) and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Store this mixture in a small clean jar. When you are ready to use it, mix a teaspoon of the mixture into 8 ounces of distilled, sterile, or previously boiled and cooled water.

Store your saline solution at room temperature and mix it before you use it. If the solution stings, use less salt next time.

## How to Use Saline Nasal Spray

Making sure you use saline nasal spray the right way can make it more effective:

- Gently blow your nose. That will help clear out snot and debris, which will help the saline nasal spray work better.
- Wash your hands well.
- Shake the bottle and take off the cap.
- Tilt your head back just a little bit and keep your mouth closed.
- Plug one nostril by pressing gently on the side of your nose.
- Place the tip of the bottle in one nostril. Aim it toward the back of your nose.
- Squeeze or pump the bottle while gently inhaling. Don’t inhale deeply or the solution may end up in your throat instead of your nasal passages.
- Repeat with the other nostril.
- Avoid blowing your nose right away.

## Saline Nasal Spray Side Effects

Saline nasal spray is a safe treatment and most people don’t have side effects. However, there’s a chance that you may develop mild, but bothersome, problems from this treatment, which can include:

- A stinging or burning sensation
- Irritation of the nasal passages
- Itching

## Who Should Not Use Saline Nasal Sprays?

Most people can safely use saline nasal sprays, but preservatives used in certain brands can cause allergic reactions in some people. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, ask your doctor if it’s okay to use saline nasal spray.

## Takeaways

If you have nasal symptoms such as congestion or dryness, using saline nasal spray may help ease them. There are many brands of saline nasal spray, for both adults and children. You can make your own saline nasal solution, but be sure to follow instructions from a reliable source.

## Saline Nasal Spray FAQs

**Is it OK to use saline nasal spray daily?**

You can use saline nasal spray as often as you need it. For small children (under age 4), ask a doctor whether daily use of saline nasal spray is okay.

**Is a saline nasal rinse good for you?**

A saline nasal rinse (also called saline nasal irrigation) can help clear out mucus and debris from your nasal passages, which may help you breathe easier when you have an allergy or cold.

**What is the difference between saline spray and nasal rinse?**

Saline sprays deliver a mix of salt and water into your nasal passages in the form of a mist. A saline nasal rinse uses greater amounts of the solution and delivers it in the form of a fluid.

## What Is Circumcision?

Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, the tissue covering the head (called the glans) of the penis. It's an ancient practice that has its origin in religious rites. Today, many parents have their babies circumcised for religious or other reasons.

Circumcision is one of the most common surgeries done worldwide. In the United States, the rate of circumcision is up to 80%, while globally, it's about 38%.

![photo of Circumcision](https://img.lb.wbmdstatic.com/vim/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/BigBead/circumcision_bigbead/1800x1200_circumcision_bigbead.jpg)

## Circumcised vs. Uncircumcised

An uncircumcised penis has a foreskin covering its head, while on a circumcised penis, the head is exposed.  Research has shown there are no differences in how an uncircumcised penis and a circumcised penis respond to touch stimulation and orgasm. Similarly, circumcision doesn’t affect sexual function or fertility.

## When Is Circumcision Done?

Circumcision is usually done on the first or second day after birth. (In Jewish tradition, circumcision is done on the eighth day.) The procedure becomes more complicated and riskier in older babies, children, and adults.

## Reasons for Circumcision

Parents who circumcise their children often do so for religious or cultural reasons. The religions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism require or recommend circumcision. Circumcision is also common in some parts of Africa, Australia, and the Middle East. Other reasons for circumcision include:

- Hygiene
- Preventing diseases such as [urinary tract infections](https://www.webmd.com/women/your-guide-urinary-tract-infections), sexually transmitted infections, and cancer
- Family reasons, like the father being circumcised
- Personal reasons

Parents who choose not to circumcise their children have reasons, including:

- It's not medically necessary
- Family reasons like the father being uncircumcised
- Fear of complications like bleeding and infection
- Concerns about the pain
- They believe it's their child's choice whether they want to be circumcised when they're older.

If you want your baby  to be circumcised, talk with the doctor who will do the procedure and ask any questions you have about it. They'll explain the risks and benefits. If, after the chat with your doctor, you're sure you want your baby to be circumcised, you'll sign an informed consent form giving your permission for the surgery.

## Circumcision Surgery

During a circumcision, the foreskin is cut from the head of the penis, and the excess tissue is clipped off.

The procedure is a bit different depending on the age at which it is done.

**Newborn circumcision**

[Newborn circumcision](https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-about-circumcision) is usually done by an obstetrician-gynecologist, a urologist, or a pediatrician. It most likely will happen in the hospital. Your child will be awake during the procedure. They’ll be placed on their back, with restraints to keep their arms and legs still.

The doctor will clean the penis area with antiseptic, then give the baby a numbing shot at the base of the penis to ease the pain. Sometimes doctors apply the pain reliever as a cream or give the baby pain medication. They’ll put a clamp or ring on the penis and remove the foreskin. A topical antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly will then be put on the area, and it’s wrapped with gauze.

It’s usually over in about 10 minutes. Your doctor will recommend [swaddling](https://www.webmd.com/baby/swaddling) your baby after the procedure by wrapping them up tightly with a blanket or having them suck on a pacifier dipped in sugar water. If it’s done in the hospital, you should be ready to take your baby home in a few hours.

Jewish families may choose to have their child circumcised during a religious ceremony called a bris. That's normally done outside the hospital by someone with special training.

**Adult circumcision**

Circumcision can also be done in older children and adults. This surgery is usually done at a hospital by a urologist. Doctors may recommend it for health conditions involving the penis, like:

- [Balanitis](https://www.webmd.com/men/penis-disorder-balanitis), which is inflammation of the head of the penis
- Balanoposthitis, which is inflammation of both the head and foreskin of the penis
- Cancerous or pre-cancerous growth on the foreskin
- Phimosis, a condition where the foreskin can't be pulled back from the head of the penis
- Paraphimosis, a condition where the foreskin can't be pulled forward into place over the head of the penis
- Posthitis, or inflammation of the foreskin
- Warts on the foreskin

Adult circumcision follows a similar procedure as newborns. But it's usually done under [general anesthesia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-general-anesthesia). After the foreskin is removed, you'll get stitches along the incision that will dissolve within about 10 days.  Adult circumcision takes about an hour. It comes with a higher risk of complications than newborn circumcision, and recovery may take up to 3 weeks.

**Types of circumcision**

Circumcision is done through three main methods:

- Gomco clamp: This is the most common circumcision method for newborns. It uses a metal device with a cap to protect the head of the penis and a circular clamp that cuts off circulation to the foreskin to control bleeding while it's removed with a scalpel or scissors.
- The Plastibell technique: In this procedure, a doctor puts a plastic cap over the head of the penis, underneath the foreskin. Surgical thread is tied tightly around the foreskin, which cuts off circulation to the tissue and causes it to die. The cap is left in place until it falls off on its own after several days.
- Mogen clamp: This metal device was invented by a rabbi. It's similar to the Gomco method, except there's no cap to protect the head of the penis. The foreskin is stretched and clamped to control bleeding while it's removed with a scalpel.

## Circumcision Surgery Follow-Up

After their circumcision, your baby may be fussy and irritable. Hold them carefully so you don’t put pressure on their penis. The tip may be sore. You may see a yellow crust on the tip as well. This is normal and should go away on its own in a few days.

Around 48 hours after the procedure, the bandage is usually not put back on once it comes off. [Lubricant](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/what-to-know-about-fertility-and-lubricants), though, should still be used to keep their penis from sticking to their diaper. If stool gets on their penis, gently wipe it away with warm, soapy water. To ward off infection, change their diaper often and fasten it loosely.

The circumcision generally heals in 5-7 days. Most of the time, babies recover without problems. Complications, like an infection, are rare. Contact your doctor if:

- Your baby doesn’t pee within 12 hours of the circumcision.
- You see blood on their diaper larger than the size of a quarter.

Older children or adults should take things slowly for 2-3 days. Rest, take pain meds and [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-are-antibiotics) as prescribed, and don't do any heavy lifting. Drink plenty of water and other clear fluids, especially in the first 24 hours after the procedure. Ice the area for up to 2 hours the first day, 10-20 minutes at a time. Wear loose, comfortable underwear and keep the dressing over the area until your doctor says to take it off.

Don't swim or take a bath for at least a week after the procedure. Avoid bike riding for at least 3 weeks and strenuous activities like running or lifting weights for 4-6 weeks.

Call the doctor right away if you have:

- Any trouble peeing
- A [fever](https://www.webmd.com/covid/what-is-a-fever)
- Any bleeding
- An unusual smell or discharge at the tip of the penis
- Blistering

If there’s a plastic ring instead of a gauze wrap, call the doctor if it stays on longer than 2 weeks.

## Is Circumcision Necessary?

Experts still debate the benefits of circumcision for medical or health reasons. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics found that though the health benefits of newborn circumcision outweigh the risks, the benefits are not great enough to recommend it across the board.

## Pros and Cons of Circumcision

Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of the procedure before deciding whether to circumcise your child. You can also consider culture, religion, and personal preference when choosing whether to circumcise your child.

**Circumcision benefits**

Evidence suggests that circumcision has health benefits, including:

- Less risk of urinary tract infections
- A lower risk of some [sexually transmitted diseases](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/understanding-stds-basics)
- Protection against cancer of the penis and a lower risk of cervical cancer in sex partners
- Prevention of balanitis (inflammation of the head of the penis) and balanoposthitis (inflammation of the foreskin and head of the penis)
- Prevention of [phimosis](https://www.webmd.com/men/phimosis) (the inability to retract the foreskin) and paraphimosis (the inability to return the foreskin to its original location)
- Circumcision also makes it easier to keep the end of the penis clean.

Some studies show that good hygiene can help prevent certain problems with the penis, including infections and swelling, even if the penis isn't circumcised. In addition, using a condom during sex will help prevent STIs and other infections.

**Circumcision Risks**

Like any other surgical procedure, there are risks in getting circumcision. But this risk is low. Problems linked to circumcision include:

- Pain
- Risk of bleeding and infection at the site of the circumcision
- Irritation of the glans
- Higher chance of meatitis (inflammation of the opening of the penis)
- Risk of injury to the penis

Some people are opposed to circumcision because they consider it to be disfiguring.

## Takeaways

[Circumcision](https://www.webmd.com/teens/circumcision-faq) removes the foreskin from the head of the penis. It's one of the most common surgeries worldwide and is generally safe. It's done on newborns, older children, and adults for many reasons. If you're considering circumcision for your child or yourself, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits.

## Circumcision FAQs

**What happens if a man is circumcised?**

Circumcision changes how someone's penis looks and may lower their risk of diseases such as [cancer of the penis](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/penile-cancer-overview), HIV, and HPV.  Doctors say it has no effect on your sexual function or fertility.

**What happens if you don't circumcise?**

When they're old enough, you'll have to teach your child to pull back their foreskin and wash underneath it. As long as you keep the area clean and use condoms, being uncircumcised will make no difference in your genital health and overall quality of life.

You may not want to talk about it in public. But a lot of guys have questions about their [penis](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/how-an-erection-occurs).

Here are answers to some of the most common questions guys have.

## When does the penis grow?

Your [penis](https://www.webmd.com/men/cm/rm-quiz-is-my-penis-normal) grows longer and wider during puberty. That's the time major changes occur in the body that make you look more like a man and less like a child. Most guys start puberty between ages 10 and 14.

But, puberty happens at different times for everyone. You may have a penis that's grown to its full size as early as age 13 or as late as age 18.

## When does a penis stop growing?

Your penis stops growing when you finish puberty. Exactly when that happens, though, varies from person to person. Everyone develops at a different pace. You may take longer than your friends or less time than them to finish puberty. But by 16, your body and its parts should be close to your adult size.

## Is my penis size normal?

There is no such thing as a "normal" penis size. The size of your penis depends on your genes, just like the size of your hands, feet, and [eye](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes) color. Keep in mind, penis size has nothing to do with manliness or sexual ability.

## Can I change my penis size?

No. You can't change the size of your penis. Despite what you may hear, no exercises, [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/diet/vitamin-supplement-glossary), or diets can change the size of your penis or make it grow faster.

## What is a morning erection?

An erection is when your penis fills with [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) and becomes hard. A morning erection is an erection you wake up with in the morning.

Morning erections are very common. In fact, most guys have about three to five erections each night while they sleep. They just don't know it.

## What is a wet dream?

A wet dream is when you ejaculate (release semen from your penis) in your [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/ss/slideshow-sleep-disorders-overview) and wake up wet. Wet [dreams](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/dreaming-overview) often occur from having sexual [dreams](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/cm/rm-quiz-dreams). Sometimes, though, they just happen. Wet dreams are a normal part of puberty. Usually, they stop as you get older.

## How can I prevent having an involuntary erection?

Unfortunately, you can't. During puberty, erections just happen. There isn't much you can do to stop them. Even thinking of the most non-sexy thing you can imagine won't help. But, over time, involuntary erections will become less frequent.

## What is masturbation?

When you masturbate, you release sexual tension. You'll have what's called an ejaculation. Ejaculation is the release of semen from your penis. Semen is made up of fluid and [sperm](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/sperm-and-semen-faq).

Many guys masturbate. In fact, one study found that 75% of boys ages 15 and 16 masturbate.

There are many myths about [masturbation](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/masturbation-guide). For example, some people say it will stunt your growth. But there is nothing wrong with doing it, as long as it doesn't become a constant desire or get in the way of other things you want or need to do.

## What is an STD?

STD stands for sexually transmitted disease. An STD is a disease you can get by having sex with someone who has one.

You do not have to have sexual intercourse to get an STD, either. You can get [STDs](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/ss/slideshow-std-pictures-and-facts) from oral [sex](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/cm/rm-quiz-sex-fact-fiction), [anal sex](https://www.webmd.com/sex/anal-sex-health-concerns), or from rubbing naked against someone who is infected.

If left untreated, many [STDs](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/cm/rm-quiz-stds) can cause long-term health problems. Some STDS, like HIV/AIDS, can be life threatening.

STDs include:

- [Gonorrhea](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/gonorrhea)
- [Chlamydia](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/chlamydia)
- Genital herpes
- Genital warts (HPV)
- Hepatitis B and C
- [Syphilis](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/syphilis)
- [HIV](https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/ss/slideshow-aids-retrospective)/AIDS
- Crabs, or pubic lice
- [Trichomoniasis](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/trichomoniasis)

If you get an STD, be sure to ask your doctor what you need to do to avoid passing it on to someone else.

## How do I know if I have an STD?

Depending on the type of STD, symptoms may include the following:

- Burning when peeing
- Discharge from the penis
- Burning and [itching](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-pruritus) around the opening of the penis
- Irritation inside the penis
- Painful and [swollen testicles](https://www.webmd.com/men/inflammation-testicle-orchitis)
- Sores on or around the penis
- Warts, or painless growths, on the penis, testicles, groin, thighs, or [anus](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-system)
- [Itching](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/cm/rm-itch-quiz) in the genital area

If you are worried you may have an STD, see a doctor or visit a health clinic to get screened. Most STDs are treated with [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cm/rm-quiz-antibiotics-myths-facts).

You can also call an STD hotline, including National STD Hotline at 800-227-8922 to get your questions answered.

## What does penile discharge mean?

Penile discharge is any unusual fluid that comes out of the penis that is not semen or urine. The discharge may be clear or yellowish green and may or may not have an odor. It depends on the cause of the discharge. Penile discharge is often a sign of an STD and should be looked at by a doctor.

## What does it mean if I feel burning when I pee?

If it burns when you pee, you may have an infection, like a [urinary tract infection](https://www.webmd.com/women/your-guide-urinary-tract-infections) or an STD. Other symptoms of infection are:

- Feeling like you have to pee constantly but, when you go, hardly anything comes out
- Seeing pink pee (from peeing [blood](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cm/rm-quiz-blood-basics))
- Having strong, distinct-smelling pee, especially in the morning
- Pain above the pubic bone

If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor or go to a health clinic to get checked. If left untreated, urinary infections and STDs can cause much bigger health problems.

## What is a circumcision?

All guys are born with foreskin. That's a fold of [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin) at the head of the penis. A [circumcision](https://www.webmd.com/teens/circumcision-faq) is a procedure performed by a doctor or clergy person in which the foreskin is cut away from the penis. Many parents choose to have the foreskin removed from their baby's penis for a variety of reasons, including:

- Cultural traditions
- Religious beliefs
- Hygiene purposes

[Circumcision](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/marks-risks-circumcision) is not usually medically necessary.

## What is the difference between a circumcised and an uncircumcised penis?

The only difference between a circumcised penis and an uncircumcised penis is that the uncircumcised penis still has foreskin. The circumcised penis does not. Other than that, there is no difference. Both penises work and feel the same.

## What are some problems with foreskin?

Many uncircumcised guys don't have any problems with foreskin. However, some problems associated with foreskin in uncircumcised guys include:

- [Inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) or infection of the penis head
- The foreskin can't be pulled back behind the head of the penis because it is too tight
- The foreskin, after being pulled back, becomes trapped behind the head of the penis; this is a medical emergency because it can cause permanent damage to the penis. You should see your doctor immediately.
- A rare condition where scar tissue forms at the tip of the penis, tightening the foreskin around the penis head; this makes it difficult for the foreskin to be pulled back.

If you have any of these problems, see your doctor.

For many people with COVID-19, fatigue is a fairly common symptom. It can make you feel dull and tired, take away your energy, and eat away at your ability to get things done. Depending on the seriousness of your COVID-19 infection, it may last 2 to 3 weeks. But for some people with a severe infection, the brain fog-like fatigue and pain can linger for weeks or months. It may last even after your COVID-19 infection clears up.

## What Does COVID Fatigue Feel Like?

When your body is fighting off a [viral infection](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/bacterial-and-viral-infections) like COVID-19, you may feel very tired and find it hard to focus. This is fatigue.

Depending on the severity, fatigue symptoms can range from:

- Chronic tiredness or sleepiness
- [Headaches](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-basics)
- Dizziness
- Sore or achy muscles
- Muscle weakness
- Slow reflexes and responses
- Poor decision-making skills
- Moodiness and irritability
- Poor hand-to-eye coordination
- Loss of appetite
- Reduced [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function) function
- [Blurry vision](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/why-is-my-vision-blurry)
- Short-term memory problems
- Poor concentration
- Inability to pay attention to surroundings or the situation at hand.
- Low motivation
- Hallucinations

## Long-Haul COVID and Fatigue

Experts say that up to 30% of the people who’ve caught the COVID-19 infection worldwide have gone on to develop COVID symptoms that lasts weeks or months long after the virus clears from the body. Doctors call this condition long-haul COVID-19 or [long COVID](https://www.webmd.com/covid/what-is-long-covid-pasc)-19\. Many people deal with ongoing chronic fatigue, or “post-viral fatigue.” Symptoms can include brain fog and pain. Researchers note that around 7% of the people with mild to severe COVID-19 may have long-term symptoms.

An estimated 13-33%% of those reporting long-COVID had ongoing fatigue 2 months after they were initially admitted to the hospital.  Up to 35% can experience fatigue as long as six months later. In milder cases, the fatigue may last 2-3 weeks from the time you test positive for COVID-19.

While experts aren’t exactly sure what causes lasting fatigue and long COVID-19, some researchers say that the body’s natural response may be thrown off after it comes in contact with certain types of infection. They believe fatigue from long COVID is similar to the symptoms of a complex condition called myalgic encephalomyelitis/ [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/default.htm) (ME/CFS).

## What Can I Do to Manage COVID Fatigue?

Fatigue can drain your energy and keep you from doing day-to-day things when you’re down with a viral sickness like COVID-19 or long-haul COVID-19.

To manage your health and ease fatigue symptoms while you’re sick or post-COVID, you should:

- Accept that fatigue is a real side effect of having COVID-19.
- Make sure to get a good night’s sleep. This can help your body preserve energy.
- Try relaxation techniques like mindful meditation, aromatherapy, [yoga](https://www.webmd.com/balance/the-health-benefits-of-yoga), and [tai chi](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/video/tai-chi-health-benefits). These can help to reduce stress and fatigue symptoms.
- Plan ahead on what you can get done with limited energy.
- Prioritize the tasks that are important. This will help you spend energy on only those things that need to be done.
- Delegate certain tasks to others who can complete them for you. This can include activities like grocery shopping or cooking.
- Try to stay active. A viral infection can knock your energy out, but moving and light exercise can energize you.
- Keep a diary on all things that either trigger your fatigue or make it worse. This will help you steer clear of energy-draining activities.
- Eat foods that give your body energy.
- Stay hydrated.

## When Should I See a Doctor About COVID Fatigue?

If you’ve had COVID-19 and you notice your fatigue symptoms lasting more than 2 to 3 weeks, it’s best to let your doctor know about it.

See your doctor if:

- Your fatigue gets worse rather than better.
- Your symptoms haven’t changed after 4 weeks.
- You are worried or have other new symptoms.

Experts and doctors are still learning about the coronavirus that’s causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a COVID-19 vaccine if you’re eligible for it to prevent a COVID infection and its symptoms.

The vaccines are safe and effective in preventing and limiting the spread of the virus. If you’ve had COVID-19, wait till the infection clears before you get one. If you’re not sure, ask your doctor.

## What Is Blue Balls?

“Blue balls” is the achy feeling you might get in your scrotum when you get sexually aroused but don't have an orgasm. Doctors call it epididymal hypertension, though it's not considered a medical problem. While it can be uncomfortable, it doesn't last long and isn't harmful to your health.

Some people also use the term "blue balls" to describe a feeling of sexual frustration. However you define it, it's never a reason to try to pressure someone to have sex. Nor should you ever feel obligated to have sex with someone because they feel physically or emotionally frustrated.

## Blue Balls Causes

When you get sexually excited, more blood flows into your genitals. That causes your penis and testicles to swell up to prepare for sex. Veins in the area get narrower to help keep this extra blood in place.

After you have an orgasm, these veins relax and the excess blood – along with the pressure it causes – gets released. But if you don't orgasm, the blood stays around for a little while. For some people, this feeling of pressure causes discomfort.

"I think of a pressure cooker," says Caroline Pukall, PhD, director of the Sexual Health Research Laboratory at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. "As the pressure is building, an orgasm is like a release valve that allows that pressure to balance again. But if you build and build and you don't release that valve, it can take some time for that pressure to go away on its own.”

It's more likely to happen when you stay sexually aroused for a long time, she says. You might get blue balls, for example, when you make out with someone, have phone sex, or watch porn.

Blue balls isn't caused by a buildup of sperm. People with female anatomy can have a similar experience, sometimes called blue vulva, blue bean, or blue clit.

**Epididymal hypertension vs epididymitis**

Epididymal hypertension (blue balls) isn't related to epididymitis, which is inflammation that can cause intense pain in your testicles. It happens when you have swelling in your epididymis, a coiled tube at the back of each testicle. It's not linked to sexual arousal and is usually caused by a bacterial infection, such as _E. coli_, or a sexually transmitted infection (STI). If you have symptoms like pain in your scrotum, swelling and redness in your testicles, blood in your semen, or pain when you pee, see a doctor right away.

## Blue Balls Symptoms

Blue balls might cause these sensations in or around your testicles:

- A heavy feeling
- Mild pain
- Achiness

The term “blue balls” comes from the belief that the extra blood in your testicles can cause them to take on a faint bluish hue. But doctors disagree about whether that's true.

There's no need to see a doctor for blue balls. But if you have pain in your testicles without being sexually aroused, especially if it's serious or lasts a long time, you probably have a medical condition like kidney stones, an injury, or an infection instead of blue balls. See a doctor if this happens to you.

If your testicles look slightly blue and you have sudden, intense pain, you might have a serious condition called testicular torsion. This happens when one of your testicles gets twisted, cutting off its blood supply. It's a medical emergency that may require surgery right away.

**How long does blue balls last?**

Most people say the uncomfortable sensation of blue balls passes on its own within a few minutes to a few hours, though a few people have reported discomfort that lasts days. “The amount of time it takes for the body to return to its non-aroused, resting state can vary from person to person and from situation to situation,” Pukall says.

## How to Get Rid of Blue Balls

The simplest way to get rid of blue balls is often just to wait it out. Once you're no longer aroused, the uncomfortable feeling will fade. For some people, a cold shower or bath speeds up this process. Others find relief by:

- Peeing
- Exercising
- Doing deep breathing techniques to help slow the heart rate

It may also help to distract yourself with things like reading or sleep.

Of course, having an orgasm through masturbation or sex with a willing partner will also do the trick. But keep in mind that it's nobody else's responsibility to relieve your sexual tension.

## Blue Balls Prevention

Since orgasm is never guaranteed, the only sure way to prevent blue balls is to avoid getting sexually excited. Limit the time you spend doing arousing things like watching porn, whether with a partner or alone. If you want to avoid blue balls while you're with a partner, communicate clearly with them ahead of time about what kinds of activities you want to avoid.

One study found that as you get older, you're less likely to get blue balls.

## Takeaways

"Blue balls," or epididymal hypertension, is an uncomfortable feeling in your testicles that may happen when you get sexually aroused and don't have an orgasm. It's caused by increased blood pressure in your genitals. It doesn't cause any harm, and it usually goes away quickly on its own. It's never an excuse to pressure someone for sex.

## Blue Balls FAQs

**Are blue balls real?**

For some people, the uncomfortable feeling that comes with blue balls is real. But doctors don’t consider its to be a medical condition, and it doesn't require any treatment. Doctors disagree over whether it really causes your testicles to have a slight blue tint.

**How serious is epididymal hypertension?**

Although it can be uncomfortable, epididymal hypertension isn't medically serious. If you have pain in your testicles that's not liked to sexual arousal, especially if it's intense or sudden, see a doctor.

## What Are Olives?

Olives are the fruit of the olive tree, _Olea europaea_, meaning “European olive.” Olive trees are grown throughout the Mediterranean Basin as well as in South America, South Africa, India, China, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and the United States.

Olives of various varieties are a main ingredient in Mediterranean dishes and a significant export crop for Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Morocco. The most common olives in the United States are green and black, though kalamata olives are also popular.

They are often sliced or used whole in recipes or pressed into olive oil, which is also a major agricultural export in the Mediterranean region.

Eating olives whole or using olive oil for certain meals may help protect against various health problems.

## Benefits of Olives

The vitamins and [antioxidants](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-antioxidants#1) found in olives may provide important health benefits. For example, some studies have shown that olives may protect against osteoporosis, in which bones become brittle or weak.

Olives are also rich in vitamin E, which can improve skin health and help your immune system.

In addition, olives may provide health benefits like:

**Heart health**

Numerous studies have shown that consuming olive oil, especially the extra-virgin variety, may reduce the risk of heart disease and death in people who have a high risk of this condition.

**Cancer risk reduction**

Olives contain the compound oleocanthal, which researchers have shown can kill cancer cells in petri dish experiments. Other studies in humans have shown a link between consuming [olive oil](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-extra-virgin-olive-oil) and reducing the risk of cancers, including breast cancer.

**Lower risk and treatment of cognitive diseases**

The oleocanthal in olives and olive oil is also linked to a reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other brain-related diseases. This compound also increases the activity of the drug donepezil, which is used to treat dementia.

**Diabetes prevention**

Research shows a link between consuming olive oil and preventing [type 2 diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes) by helping the body regulate glucose (sugar). Unregulated glucose can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes.

**Reduce chronic inflammation**

Chronic inflammation plays a key role in many diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Olives are packed with antioxidants, which have been shown to help with chronic inflammation.

Two kinds of antioxidants found in olives, hydroxytyrosol and oleanolic acid, have been effective in reducing inflammation in animals. Animal studies have also shown oleanolic acid’s health benefits in promoting liver health and regulating fat levels in their blood.

## Are Olives Good for You?

Olives are rich in [vitamin E](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-vitamin-e) and other antioxidants, which may help reduce the risk of health conditions like cancer, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.

Olives also contain:

- Vitamin A
- Copper
- Calcium
- Iron
- Vitamin E

**Health risks of eating olives**

Olives provide many health benefits, but they are still relatively high in fat. Canned olives are often packed in brine, which makes them high in sodium (salt). Just one green olive contains 62.4 milligrams of sodium, so salt content can add up quickly. The CDC estimates that 90% of American adults get too much sodium.

A high-sodium diet can contribute to cardiovascular (heart-related) disease. The CDC recommends that adults get less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day.

Fresh olives are a healthier choice if you are watching your sodium intake. Pay attention to portion sizes when eating canned olives, and make sure to balance your sodium intake by eating foods that are rich in [potassium](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-potassium).

## How to Prepare Olives

You can buy olives in many forms at most grocery stores. You can find them canned or bottled in a salt solution or water. You may be able to find fresh olives at a grocery or local Mediterranean specialty store.

[Olives](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/olive-uses-and-risks) can be served whole, and often are when they make an appearance on a charcuterie board or cheese plate.

It is possible to extract the oil from olives to make your own olive oil, but this process is complex. If you want to try, you’ll need to gather several pieces of equipment:

- A millstone or another grinder
- An immersion blender
- A weight such as a brick or heavy book
- A clean surface for pressing
- Bottles
- A funnel

The basic steps include cold-pressing olives to extract the olive oil and then discarding the remainder. Cold-pressing allows you to extract oil without using heat, which leaves the oil as intact as possible.

Here are some other ways to use olives and olive oils in recipes:

- Drizzled on hummus
- As a cocktail garnish or ingredient
- As a salad dressing base
- To replace less healthy oils in baking recipes
- Chop up to use in a tapenade
- Slice and use as a pizza topping
- Add to pasta dishes
- Slice and use as a sandwich topping
- Stuff large olives with soft [cheese](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-cheese) and serve as an appetizer

## What Are Lemons?

The lemon is a bright yellow citrus fruit.It has its distinctive sour taste and fresh scent because it's rich in citric acid. It comes from the flowering plant family _Rutaceae_, and its scientific name is _Citrus limon_.

The lemon's unique flavor makes it a popular ingredient in drinks, desserts, and meals. Almost all parts of a lemon can be used in cooking.

Lemons can also be used for cleaning. The citric acid in lemon juice can kill bacteria and other germs.

Exactly where lemons came from isn't known. But there's documented evidence of its value from almost 2,000 years ago. The lemon tree grows in subtropical and tropical areas and can grow 10-20 feet tall. Most are grown in Mediterranean countries, as well as China, India, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. They also grow in California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida in the U.S. You can find fresh lemons year-round in supermarkets.

Lemon juice has many uses, from [culinary](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-is-culinary-medicine) to medicinal. Lemons are used all over the world in desserts, drinks, sauces, dips, and as a garnish for meat and fish dishes. Lemon juice is a natural cleaner and stain remover. Lemon oil provides the fragrance for perfumes, soaps, and skin creams.

**Are lemons a fruit?**

Yes. In biology, a fruit is the part of a plant with seeds.

## Types of Lemons

The most commonly grown lemon in the U.S. is the Eureka lemon. The Lisbon lemon is also popular.

You may also come across the Meyer lemon, a smaller, sweeter lemon that may have gotten its start as a cross between a lemon and a [mandarin orange](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-mandarin-oranges). These can make good house plants, but you'll need to bring them inside in the winter if you're not in a tropical climate.

When you buy lemons, look for those that are bright and have an even color and a smooth, blemish-free surface. Lemons should be firm but not too hard. Those with thinner skin tend to be juicier. You can tell if your lemon is ripe by checking its weight. It's ripe when it feels heavy for its size.

While you can find lemons year-round at your grocery store, peak seasonality in the U.S. is late winter to early spring and summer depending on the variety and the climate where they're grown. Store them in the refrigerator so they'll last longer than at room temperature.

## Health Benefits of Lemons

The vitamins, fiber, and plant compounds in lemons can be part of a healthy diet. It's not common to actually eat a fresh lemon--they're too sour for most people's tastes--unless you're using preserved lemons. But you can also eat lemons with a variety of foods.

Lemons can also provide important health benefits like:

**Vitamin C**

Lemons contain about 35 milligrams of vitamin C, which is over half the amount of [vitamin C](https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-vitamin-c) needed in your daily diet. Vitamin C is an antioxidant, which helps protect cells from damage. Vitamin C also helps your body make collagen for your skin, helps your body absorb iron, and supports your immune system. Citrus fruits are some of the best food sources of vitamin C.

Lemon also contains a high level of dietary fiber, but you don't get fiber from juice.

**Weight management**

The pectin fiber found in lemons expands once it is ingested, making you feel full sooner and longer. Lemon water is often touted as an effective tool in weight loss and weight management. While there's nothing wrong with drinking water, there's nothing magical about adding lemon to water for weight control. Also, drinking water may keep you full and help you avoid snacking as effectively as sipping lemon water.

**Anemia prevention**

Lemon can help your body absorb more iron from plant-based foods in your diet. Maintaining proper iron levels helps prevent [anemia.](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics) Anemia is a lower-than-average number of red blood cells, which often happens as a result of iron deficiency.

**Kidney stone prevention**

Lemons get their sour taste from their abundance of citric acid. Some studies show that citric acid may help prevent the formation of [kidney stones](https://www.webmd.com/kidney-stones/understanding-kidney-stones-basics).

**Enhances your complexion**

The vitamin C in lemons helps to form collagen, a protein that supports your skin. The vitamin C, folic acid, vitamin B, and minerals in lemon may help to improve your acne, oily skin, blackheads, and dandruff.

Vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants help to prevent cell damage caused by oxidative stress, which can enhance skin health. Early research suggests that drinking a beverage made with lemon juice may improve your complexion and slow the aging of your skin.

You can get these benefits by eating lemons or applying lemon directly to your skin. Lemon is a common ingredient in many cosmetics products--you can also make your own but check with your doctor first.

**Reduced risk of heart disease**

Research links consuming lemons with lowering your risk of stroke and heart disease. The flavonoids in citrus fruits may help reduce the risk of ischemic stroke (when blood flow to your brain is reduced or blocked) in those assigned female at birth.

Plant compounds found in lemons--namely limonin, hesperidin, and diosmin--have also been found to lower your cholesterol levels.

**Antibacterial effects**

Lemon juice has antibacterial and antifungal properties. The plant compounds in lemon juice concentrate effectively inhibited the growth of salmonella, staphylococcus, and candida infections in one study. It was also effective against one particular antibiotic-resistant bacteria that causes pneumonia and blood infections.

**Cancer prevention and treatment research**

Lemon juice is a valuable source of nutrients called flavonoids. These are antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage that could lead to cancer. But lemon juice hasn't been studied for cancer prevention in people. While a healthy diet may help lower the risk of cancer, no one food has been shown to prevent cancer.

Lemon juice is not part of cancer treatment. But scientists have found tiny nanoparticles in lemon juice that--in lab tests on cells--inhibited cell reproduction and activated cancer cell death. This is extremely early research that's more about searching for new cancer treatments and isn't based on the lemon juice you'd get in your diet.

**Immune system support**

One lemon can offer about half of your recommended daily value of vitamin C, which contributes to immune system defense and may help the body fight infection. Lemons also contain citrus flavonoids. These antioxidants fight free radicals, have [anti-inflammatory](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) effects, and can reduce your risk of brain disease and other degenerative diseases.

**Lower blood pressure**

Physical activity helps to control high blood pressure, strengthen your heart, and reduce stress. Studies have found that the flavonoids in lemon help lower your blood pressure as well. Additional research showed this effect enhances the heart-healthy benefits of physical activity.

**Reduced risk of diabetes**

Lemons contain a natural compound called hesperidin that may lower blood sugar levels, decreasing your risk of diabetes. In addition, the citric acid in lemons slows the conversion of starch to sugar, helping reduce blood sugar spikes and aiding in weight management.

## Lemon Nutrition Facts

Lemons are an excellent source of:

- Vitamin C
- Dietary fiber
- Citric acid
- [Iron](https://www.webmd.com/diet/iron-rich-foods)

**Nutrients per serving**

A half-cup serving of lemon contains:

- Calories: 31
- Protein: 1 gram
- Fat: 0 grams
- Carbohydrates: 10 grams
- Fiber: 3 grams
- Sugar: 3 grams

## ​​Side Effects of Lemons

Lemons have a high acid content. In excess, this citrus fruit can cause discomfort or worsen symptoms of certain medical conditions, including:

**Citrus allergies**

If you're allergic to grass pollen or citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, or limes, you may also be allergic to lemons. The most common reactions are itching, burning, or swelling of the mouth and throat. Some people can have headaches or gastrointestinal distress.

**Migraines**

Lemon juice is high in the amino acid tyramine. If you are sensitive to tyramine, drinking lemon juice can trigger [migraine](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-migraines) headaches.

**Aggravate acid reflux**

Lemons can worsen heartburn symptoms in people with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In high amounts, lemon juice can also irritate your stomach and cause nausea.

**Tooth decay**

In high concentrations, the acid in lemon juice can wear down your tooth enamel and cause cavities. Make sure to add enough water to lemon tea to dilute this acidity.

**Canker sores**

Lemons may trigger canker sores or irritate existing ones, which can cause discomfort and make them take longer to heal.

**Medication interactions**

While research specific to lemons is inconclusive, some citrus juices interact with certain cholesterol and blood pressure medications.

## Portion Sizes

Lemon juice is a flavorful and healthy addition to many recipes. Like all fruits, it contains natural sugar -- but not very much. Use it as a recipe directs.

## How to Use Lemon

With their distinct sour taste, lemons add a bold flavor to many recipes. Lemon is a popular ingredient in cooking and baking, and you can use almost every part of this versatile fruit.

A simple lemon wedge can add a refreshing flavor to water and tea.

[Hummus](https://www.webmd.com/diet/hummus-recipe-and-benefits), which originated in the Middle East and is now popular worldwide, is traditionally made with lemon juice (as well as chickpeas, tahini, and garlic).

Preserved lemons are part of traditional Moroccan cuisine. And in India, lemon pickle is a condiment.

Lemon juice and zest, often paired with butter or oil, is a crucial ingredient in many popular seafood and meat dishes as well as desserts.

The rind of the lemon can be zested and added to baked goods, tea, soup, and beverages of all kinds. Here are a few ways to prepare this versatile and vibrant fruit:

- Make a classic, ice-cold lemonade with organic sugar or sugar alternative and water.
- Use lemon to add flavor to a risotto dish or brighten up a soup.
- Create a refreshing lemon and butter sauce for a salmon or chicken plate.
- Bake a zesty and sweet lemon meringue pie.
- Indulge in a luxurious, zesty lemon bar.
- Use lemon zest as a tasty garnish in your tea or alcoholic beverage.
- Make a delicious Greek lemon and chicken soup.

## Lemon Tea

Drinking lemon tea is a refreshing way to get many important vitamins. It's easy to prepare, hydrates your body, and is low in calories and sugar.

Lemon tea is a low-sugar, low-calorie way to add a range of vitamins and minerals to your diet.

Grating lemon zest into your tea also adds the peel's [limonene](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1105/limonene). This antioxidant, found in fruit peels, may lower your risk of cancer, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and other chronic diseases.

## Takeaways

You can get many health benefits from adding lemons to your diet. You can also try lemons for cleaning and a variety of cosmetic uses. But check with your doctor before eating or drinking large quantities of lemon as its acidity can hurt your teeth, stomach, or skin (if applied topically).

## Lemon FAQs

**Is it OK to eat a lemon a day?**

Yes, as long as you aren't getting any side effects, it's fine to eat a lemon daily. In fact, there are many health benefits to eating lemon regularly.

Proprioception, otherwise known as [kinesthesia](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/balance-your-way-to-stronger-body#1), is your body’s ability to sense movement, action, and location. It’s present in every muscle movement you have.

Without proprioception, you wouldn’t be able to move without thinking about your next step. Proprioception allows you to walk without consciously thinking about where to place your foot next. It lets you touch your elbow with your eyes closed.

## The Anatomy of Proprioception

Proprioception results from sensory receptors in your nervous system and body. Most of these receptors are located in your muscles, joints, and tendons.

When you move, the receptors send detailed messages to your brain about your positions and actions. Your brain processes these messages and works with your vision, [nervous system](https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-nervous-system), and [vestibular system](https://www.webmd.com/brain/vestibular-disorders-facts) to create your perception of where your body is and how you’re moving.

## What is a Proprioception Disorder?

Certain conditions can make proprioception difficult. You may have these symptoms if you have a proprioception disorder:

- Falling when you walk across uneven surfaces
- You don’t understand your own strength. For example, you may not know how much force to use when writing or picking up a brick
- Uncoordinated movement, such as finding it hard to walk straight
- Balance issues, which can lead to problems when you walk up or down stairs or cause you to fall

These conditions may cause proprioception disorder:

- [Brain injuries](https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-injuries-causes-types)
- [Autism spectrum disorders (ASD)](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm)
- [Multiple sclerosis](https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/what-is-multiple-sclerosis) (MS)
- [Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)](https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-als-basics) or Lou Gehrig’s disease
- Joint injuries
- Joint replacement surgery, especially hip replacement surgery
- Parkinson’s disease
- Huntington disease
- Stroke
- [Arthritis](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/default.htm)
- Herniated disc
- [Peripheral neuropathy](https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-peripheral-neuropathy-basics)

## Diagnosing Proprioception Disorder

If you’re having symptoms of proprioception disorder, your doctor will ask about your health and medical history, including recent surgeries and existing medical conditions.

They’ll then examine you and do proprioception tests. These include:

**TTDPM Test.** The threshold to detect passive motion is a test is used on different joints throughout your body. Your doctor uses a machine that moves one of your limbs in a particular direction at different speeds while you’re blindfolded. You report which direction you think the movement was.

**‌JPR Test.** Similar to the TTDPM test, the joint position recognition test involves a machine and blindfold. While you’re blindfolded, the machine moves one of your joints in a certain direction. Then, the joint is returned to its initial position. You’ll try to reenact the motion on your own.

**‌Thumb Finding Test.** The doctor moves your hand in a certain position. With your eyes shut, you touch the thumb of one hand with your other forefinger and thumb.

**Distal Proprioception Test.** The doctor moves your big toe up and down in front of you. You then try to duplicate this movement with your eyes closed.

**Sequential Finger Touching.** You touch your thumb with each of your fingers, starting with the forefinger.

**‌Romberg Test.** This is the most common proprioceptive disorder test. For 30 seconds, you stand on your own with your eyes closed and your heels together. Your doctor will observe any swaying or other signs of imbalance.

**Field Sobriety Test.** This is the same series of tests law enforcement officers use to test drunk drivers. The standardized field sobriety test (SFST) includes the walk-and-turn (WAT) test and the one-leg stand (OLS) test.

- For the WAT test,  you walk in a straight line by placing one foot in front of the other
- The HGN test requires you to follow a slow-moving pencil or other object with your eyes
- For the OLS test, you stand with one foot off the floor

**‌** If your doctor thinks your proprioception disorder is the result of an injury or another medical condition, you may also need these tests:

- A nerve conduction velocity test, which uses electrodes to see how well your nerves work
- X-rays
- Blood tests
- MRI scan

## Treatment for Proprioception Disorder

Along with treatment for whatever is causing your proprioception disorder, you’ll probably also do exercises and therapy to improve your coordination and balance.

Here are some popular ways to treat proprioception disorder:

- Tai chi, which can boost proprioception in your legs
- Core exercises, which improve [balance](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-ways-to-improve-balance)
- Physical therapy, which boosts strength, motor skills, and balance
- Somatosensory stimulation training, which uses exercises or electrical stimulation to improve proprioception

Proprioception training can also reduce your risk of injuries and [muscle deterioration](https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/ss/slideshow-muscle-weakness). Talk to your doctor about what exercises would benefit you the most, given your medical history, overall health, and age. Your doctor will create a custom treatment plan for your proprioception disorder.

[Chlorophyll](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/chlorophyll-uses-and-risks) is the natural compound present in green plants that gives them their color. It helps plants to absorb energy from the sun as they undergo the process of photosynthesis. This nutrient is present in green [vegetables](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20090706/vegetable-protein-lowers-blood-pressure) and other plant-based foods, like [algae](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/why-health-is-kelp-good-for-me). The greener the vegetable is, the higher its chlorophyll content.

Chlorophyllin, derived from chlorophyll is semi-synthetic and water-soluble. It is commonly used as an [additive](https://www.webmd.com/special-reports/food-additives/video/what-food-additives) to medicines or food colorings. It is also used to treat wounds.

## Health Benefits

The benefits of chlorophyll on the human body are still in the early stages of investigation. However, research has already found that this compound does indeed provide certain health benefits. Talk to your health care provider if you want to try a supplement.

**Cancer Prevention**

Animal studiesshow that chlorophyll can reduce the occurrence of [cancerous](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/qa/what-is-cancer) tumors. It was found that chlorophyll can form close bonds to [carcinogenic](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/news/20161104/seven-new-carcinogens-list) chemicals called aflatoxins. When they bind, the chlorophyll helps to block the absorption of the aflatoxins (cancer-causing agents) in the intestines. Additional studies in humans are needed to support these findings.

Chlorophyll also helps to prevent damage done to genes by harmful aflatoxins. Scientists are studying the effects of chlorophyll intake when it comes to liver, [skin](https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/qa/what-is-skin-cancer), stomach, and [colon cancers](https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/video/kemeny-colon-cancer-hereditary). It’s important to note that this research is on chlorophyllin and not natural chlorophyll. This is so that the dosage can be monitored more accurately.

Research in early studies on humans shows that taking 100-milligram doses of chlorophyllin three times a day for four months decreased aflatoxin damage to DNA by up to 55%. Other studies show that there is a connection between eating vegetables and cancer protection. The higher your daily intake of green vegetables is, your body has a better effect of cancer prevention.

**Antioxidant Effects**

Chlorophyll has antioxidant properties, even though they're not as strong as those found in other nutrients like [vitamins C](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/qa/what-is-vitamin-c) and E. Some studies show that regular intake of leafy, green vegetables helps to increase antioxidants in the bloodstream.

Limited studies show that chlorophyll may also decrease oxidative damage done by harmful carcinogens. So far, these studies have only been tested on animals and await human trials.

## Health Risks

Natural chlorophyll has no known side effects and so far only has benefits for humans. However, chlorophyllin as a supplement may have some possible side effects that you should consider such as:

- Occasional [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/baby/diarrhea)
- Discoloration of the urine or feces
- Discoloration of the tongue
- Mild burning or itching when applied directly to a wound

It’s also important to note that the safety of taking chlorophyllin has not yet been studied in women who are pregnant or [breastfeeding](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/breastfeeding-directory). These women should not take a chlorophyllin supplement until further research has been carried out.

## Amounts and Dosage

Chlorophyll is abundant in [plant-based](https://www.webmd.com/diet/qa/which-plantbased-foods-have-phytonutrients) foods, yet, has the highest concentration in green vegetables. It is recommended to eat at least 4 servings of green vegetables a day, however, there is no recommended amount of chlorophyll to ingest per day.

**Spinach and Leafy Greens**

[Spinach](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/spinach-recipes-directory) has a high chlorophyll concentration, with around 24 milligrams per one-cup serving. This vegetable is easy to prepare, as you can eat it raw or cooked in different ways. Other leafy greens have between 4-15 milligrams of chlorophyll per raw serving. These include:

- Bok choy
- Lettuce
- Beet greens
- Green cabbage
- Collard greens
- Swiss chard
- Algae
- Turnip greens
- Parsley
- Kale
- Mustard greens

**Other Vegetables**

Other green vegetables are good sources of chlorophyll, which also contain up to 15 milligrams per serving. These include:

- Broccoli
- Cucumbers
- Green beans
- Asparagus
- Leeks
- Brussel sprouts
- Peas

**Fruits, Nuts, and Seeds**

Small amounts of chlorophyll are present in green [fruits](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/video/how-to-safely-wash-fruit) like kiwi and green grapes. There is also a small chlorophyllic concentration in green nuts and seeds, like pistachios.

**Supplements**

Green algae like chlorella and [spirulina](https://www.webmd.com/diet/spirulina-health-benefits#1) are often sold as chlorophyll supplements. Since natural chlorophyll is more expensive, over-the-counter supplements that are marked as having chlorophyll are usually chlorophyllin supplements.

Using oils in your [hair care](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/ss/slideshow-best-kept-hair-secrets) is a hot trend, from products infused with [essential oils](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-essential-oils) to homemade coconut oil deep conditioners.

But they’re not new. For centuries, people have used oils for various medicinal and cosmetic purposes. Now, you can find them in many shampoos, serums, and other hair care products. You can also use them to make your own [hair care](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cm/rm-quiz-hair-care) treatments.

## Essential Oils and Carrier Oils

Essential oils are distilled from the plant itself. They have the signature scent of the plant they came from. And they’re highly concentrated. For instance, it takes 220 pounds of lavender flowers to make a single pound of lavender oil.

Carrier oils (such as coconut oil, jojoba oil, almond oil, and olive oil) also come from plants, but they have a more neutral smell. And they’re not necessarily distilled down like essential oils are.

Here are the benefits of some essential and carrier oils:

- **Almond oil** soothes and moisturizes the scalp.
- **Cedarwood oil** stimulates the scalp and promotes [hair](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics) growth.
- **Chamomile oil** adds shine and softness to hair, and soothes the scalp.
- **Clary sage oil** promotes hair growth and stimulates the scalp.
- [**Coconut oil**](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1092-coconut+oil.aspx?activeingredientid=1092&activeingredientname=coconut+oil) softens hair and increases shine.
- **Geranium oil** strengthens hair.
- **Jojoba oil** moisturizes the hair, adds nutrients, and stimulates the scalp.
- **Lavender oil** deep conditions the hair, keeps it shiny, and helps control [dandruff](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-dandruff-basics).
- **Moroccan argan oil** moisturizes, nourishes, and provides antioxidants to hair.
- **Rosemary oil** stimulates the roots, improves hair growth, and increases circulation in the scalp.
- **Sandalwood oil** helps with dry ends, and adds fragrance to the hair.

## How to Use Essential Oils for Your Hair

You only need a few drops of an essential oil. You can mix one or more types in a shampoo or conditioner. Or mix the drops into 2 ounces of a carrier oil.

Be aware that if you put some essential oils directly on to your scalp, they may cause irritation. Read label instructions for how to dilute oils, and never use more than the recommended amount.

If you're allergic to plants such as ragweed, test the oil on a small area of your [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedures-overview-skin) or scalp to see if you have a reaction.

Try these combos:

- Cedarwood, clary sage, and lavender
- Jojoba, clary sage, and cedarwood

After you apply the oil mixture, cover your head in a towel or shower cap.

You can wash out the treatment after 30 minutes, leave it on overnight and shampoo in the morning, or use some as a leave-in conditioner. See what works best for your hair texture.
