so good morning Dr Ang thank you very

much for coming to see us today uh my

name is Moira white and I'm chairing the

panel and other members of the panel

have their names in front of them so in

a moment I'm going to ask you to tell us

a little bit about yourself and your

project and then I'm going to pass you

over to Professor Ahmed and then

Professor mallister Williams to ask you

some questions so when you're ready

perhaps you'd like to give your

presentation thank

you so I'm Dr Joan Ang I'm a specialist

registar training in Pediatric neology

at Great Orman Street hospital and I

want to be an academic pediatric

neologist so my training is is purely

clinical at the moment but I've been

able to do some clinical research

leading to 12 first author Publications

but over time my interest has really

become focused in tarted movement

disorders I've been working with Dr Manu

Kuran in a specific childhood

parkinsonan disorder called dopamine

transporter deficiency syndrome she

delineated the clinical features and

identified that it was due to loss of

function in the SLC 6 A3 G so it looks

like a cerebal py mimic the patients

look like they've got cereal py and they

progressed severely to parkinsonism and

it's completely unresponsive to medical

or surgical treatments and a third of

the patients die I really believe as a

child neurologist we really don't have

enough treatments for our patients and

they have severe heavy Health burden

that they carry on into adulthood with

personal and societal cost so my project

is really to develop a new treatment for

dopamine transporter deficiency and

using gene therapy to deliver a normal

copy of the gene as a new treatment so

my plan is to use adino adino Associated

virus to deliver a normal copy of the

gene to a mouse model that recapitulates

the human disease to restore Gene

function protein function and rescue the

mouse phenotype I'll be trained at UCL

by Professor Thrasher and Dr wadington

Who already have a good track record in

translating pre-clinical genune therapy

to clinical trial I think really my

feature would be to be trained as a

clinician scientist to translate these

treatments for children with childhood

neurological disorders thank you thank

you very much Professor ahed thank you I

really enjoyed reading your project

thanks so much for uh submitting it I

have a couple of questions and be really

good to go through this so first of all

I was trying to understand this

particular syndrome how common it is

could you give me an idea how common the

dtds is so it's a monogenic disease it's

aosm recessive so it will be a rare

disease yeah so we look after 30

patients ourselves it's really been

recently identified in 20 9 and was

misdiagnosed in all our patients with

cereal py so I believe it to be

underrecognized right um so there are

other similar neurotransmitter disorders

and if you look at them they there are

hundreds of these patients all over the

world so I think there will be hundreds

and of patients you mentioned that there

were some similarities to the adult

condition and and there are some similar

uh conditions in adults could you just

elaborate a little bit more on that so

I've been working with Dr Karen and I

identified new cohort actually so we've

identified eight typical presentations

where children much older so age 10

present with Tremor and Frank

parkinsonism um and another group have

identified early on set Parkinson's with

loss of function in this Gene as well so

it's an involving disease spectrum and

these people are also these adults are

also resistant to standard therapies as

as far as we're aware yes right right

okay U just just just moving down into

the background of your project I was um

you mentioned that well you refer to a

figure one but I couldn't actually see a

figure one in in the case could you and

this is about the work you've done

yourself which is looking at trafficking

defects is that is that right so I think

it should have been in the peneses but

um it's looking at expression levels of

the dopamine transporter so we did um

inv vitro mutagenesis of um the

mutations we identified and expect

expressed the mutant um protein in a

cell line HEC 293 cell line and looked

at the the dopamine transporter

expression level so you can look at it

using a biotinated imuno blot where you

look at the expression at the cell

surface and then compare that to a total

cell late and it can tell you where the

protein is being moved to the cell

surface

appropriately um so we could identify

that some mutations they don't move the

dopamine transporter to the cell surface

where it needs to act right and and um I

was trying to understand what was the

part of the work which you actually did

in this particular project um developing

this construct of the instit mut Genesis

and the total s State um Western blot

analysis so bated studies and the

dopamine uptake studies were done by our

collaborators in New York okay okay all

right um so moving into your to the

model itself which you are are proposing

uh which is the D knockout model um and

this is specifically referring to study

one I was trying to figure out why you

picked this particular model um because

I think there are other models as well

is that right so um I believe that the

doine so the that knockout really

recapitulates the human disease most

similarly to the patients that we see So

20% of our patients don't express that

when you look at their functional

studies um there are two other Knockin

Mouse models available but they really

don't recapitulate the disease phenotype

The Knockout in early presentation is

hyperkinetic so it's very hyper looa and

as they age they become parkinsonian so

they become tremulus bruc kinetic and

lose weight they develop a scoliosis and

and die so 67% Survive by 10 weeks and a

third die and this is what we see in our

patients so so there is a so to

interrupt you there's so many things I

want to ask you there's not a lot of

time um the um and S there is a

knockdown model as well of of D and

there's probably a hety model as well

and in in in in the disease itself is

this there's probably a spectrum to this

is that right in in the humans there is

a yes there is a dizzy Spectrum yeah but

the knockdown and the KN uh the

knockdown model and the heterozygotes

don't represent what we see in the

patients really so phenotypic

or on um so protein expression for

example yeah yeah okay um your study two

which is developing the gene transfer

how long do you think it will take you

to do that

work um so I think it will take about a

year to develop um the appropriate gene

therapy construct so it's really

identifying that we're um using reporing

studies to Target the right cell types

um and that we deliver it successfully

to AAL Mouse yeah and what's Plan B if

that doesn't work

um in what's uh you there's presumably

there's a fair amount of track record on

the lab for work is that right yeah U so

you could then so the difficulty with

using neice as a size but Dr warington

is a internationally renowned peral Gene

therapist um the difficulty with that is

actually delivering it to the right

regions in the brain and then you could

go into an adult masse model and do a

stereotactic delivery of your gene

therapy as an alternative okay okay um

so uh another question which I had was

about numbers and and why did you

actually choose those numbers and and

that was particularly relevant to study

three which which you have and I was

trying to understand that a little bit

about um you haven't actually put down

numbers in in the in the in the case for

support and I was trying to figure out

uh what numbers of mice were you going

to use and and why were you going to

decide on those numbers uh so I would be

guided by Dr wton um who's got lots of

experience in um analyzing statistics of

animal studies but in my general

principle that um they've guided me with

is that we would treat 10 knockout mice

have 10 untreated mice and 10 wild type

mice that we would study as a cohort

okay with our first Gene therap

experiment and we would try to refine um

as as possible really because it relates

to study 4 whereas also trying to figure

out about you mentioned detail postnatal

phenotyping experiments um and you're

you're looking at a number of variables

and I was trying to figure out what are

the important variables because you've

you've also said that you're going to

retrospectively power um these studies

um so did you have a feel for what was

the most important variable you're going

to look at so I'm trying to use this as

a model for childhood movement disorder

so the mootor phenotyping is really

important and looking at the protein

expression and that the transporter is

functional so that we reduce the

neurotransmitter levels in the in the

mouse model after gene therapy so those

are the most significant um aspects of

the project okay all right

um the one of the other issues about

your studies was I was trying to figure

out what do you think is is the right of

doing this and

is you've got the D knockout mice and

then you've got the um and then

following the transaction St you've got

another group um but you've also got the

background of the mice itself yeah um

your control at the moment is the what's

the control group here the control would

be a wild type late wild type which

would have the same genetic background

and a knockout liate that's untreated

okay and then you've got it treated yeah

so you got three groups yeah whereas in

the in the case at the moment which you

have proposed at the moment are there

two groups yeah sorry is that right yeah

so okay all right do you want to yes I

was just trying to would you would you

then think about having the third group

as well um yes we will definitely yeah

okay all right okay thank you

thanks all right thank you very much

indeed um it's a very interesting

Proposal with some very uh novel

experimental uh methods um I was

wondering if we could maybe um go back

and uh and go through some of the stages

of the project and again because I just

got a couple of questions about some of

the elements of this um first of all

with regard to your that knockout mice

and you're you're establishing that

model characterizing that model that's

going to be essential for Baseline um I

I guess um you're measuring quite a

number of different elements of the

phenotype

correct of of your of your basic

knockout okay and one of the ones that

you you list here is irritability so I

was wondering how you measure your

irritability in your knockout mice um

well I think that's probably a clinici

writing um a a basic science proposal

because the Fe feature of the patients

is that they're very irritable um so I

think um it would be difficult uh to

assess irritability so so um certainly

I've spent some time in Dr woodington's

lab um looking at behavioral um studies

with his

postto um and um the mice do appear to

be

um need to have be in a calm environment

for example uh to be assessed more

appropriately but it's it would be very

difficult to quantify this so so do you

have any behavioral measure that you

might feel is akin to measuring

irritability axy for measuring

irritability not not to worry because

your your main thing is to do with the

motor motor Behavior okay um now then

into to the step two where you're

actually developing the um Gene transfer

Vector um I guess one of the issues when

you give any of these vectors is that

you can get an immune response to the

vector so um are you measuring that at

all and what sort of issues might that

cause um so there have been studies

showing that

um there isn't an obvious neuroimmune

response to AV vectors but um you could

essentially do an empty capsid injection

study um so you inject av9 without the

human um that Gene um and look for

neuroinflammatory response on

imunohistochemistry we do um h& studies

for example okay but but I'm sorry I

missed the first bit of your your answer

you saying that um the evidence is that

you don't tend to get that much with the

the vector that you're using the aav9

certainly in um Dr woodington's

experience yes okay okay that's that's

encouraging to know um all right now

you're then going to use your your

vector to transfer to the the that

knockout so in stage three you're you're

really wanting to um look at the

phenotype and see whether the

transection has been successful and

you're doing this at two different time

points is that is that correct yeah yeah

the transections at two different time

points yeah yeah yeah yeah and you're

saying that if the gene therapy is

successful F the trials at other time

points will be conducted so how will you

define

successful so it's uh rescuing of the um

knockout phenotype so looking at

survival so

and unre so from the papers 67% of the

de knockout only only survived by 10

weeks of age they have decreased in

weight so we'd hope that the weight

would improve and they have a very

specific hyperlocomotor

phenotype um so you would expect that

their movement would change towards wild

type levels in an open field a change in

um roast Rod performance for example Etc

how much have they got to improve though

for you to count as as a success so I

would hope that they would be restored

towards wild type level uh you'd hope

that but I mean you you you need you're

going to need to be able to say you know

this has been effective or not I mean so

you know how much of an improvement does

it have to be 10%

90% um well improving survival from 67%

to 100% would be successful but we'd

have to do statistical analysis to see

what would be significant really well

yes but then aren't you talking about

statistical significance as opposed to

clinical

significance I mean what would be

clinically significant

for these

mice uh so I think survival is a huge um

important factor modification in their

motor phenotype towards the wild type

ltimate levels and um a reduction in

their neurotransmitter markers so that

the dop metabolite comes down okay okay

could I ask a follow question please um

your future career aims as you as you

said at the beginning is to become an

academic pediatric neurologist with an

interest in movement disorders um this

projects very interesting but it strikes

me that what you're going to be learning

is how to apply Gene Therapies in an

animal setting um how relevant are the

skills that you're going to learn

through this project how relevant they

going to be to your ultimate future

career as a pediatric neurologist so I

think I really believe this work should

be translated um to the patient so my

clinical work we really understanding

the natural history of this disease and

we understanding what would be for

example clinically significant if we

could translate this in a clinical trial

um so I think these things would work in

parallel um

where I can use my skills having been

trained in science to really understand

how we can approach the problems our

patients face and really look at new

treatments these patients don't have any

treatment at the moment okay thank you

very much Professor Armitage okay well

thank you thank you very much I'm uh the

question I'm going to ask may be uh um

seems naive but what what is what are

the prospects for being able to do

stereotactic gene therapy in these

children and I I think in your in your

proposal you talk about intraputaminal

Vector delivery in in another condition

is this a sort of viable Way Forward I

mean that may may be naive but is that

is that what you're hoping to be able to

do yes definitely so um there is a very

similar condition called ADC deficiency

which is another diergic

neurotransmitter disease um so it's like

the enzyme one up in this dopamine

pathway and they've already undertaken

clinical trials of Gene a gene therapy

for this disorder really showing quite

remarkable um response um so these

children are nonverbal they can't sit or

lift their head and after doing therapy

are now walking um so we would and

there's also been other studies in

Parkinson's disease and it's very it's

exactly the same technique stereotyp

delivery of gene therapy in Parkinson's

disease and aadc deficiency how long

does the therapy work last I mean do you

have to give it repeatedly or can so um

certainly in the long-term Parkinson's

disease um gene therapy trials they have

follow-up data of over 12 years showing

ongoing expression of the gene um the

ADC um study is quite recent but they

have um clinical effects so and um

evidence of effect on Imaging at four

years followup thank

you uh so you were pushed a little bit

earlier about what success would look

like I think that's a really important

point and I would I think it probably

encourage you to try and set some

parameters before you start it would be

really good I want to ask you about the

flip side of that what would failure

look like because that's as important in

terms of whether you take this forward

so do you have any clear benchmarking of

if I see this I need to stop so failure

would be either no effect of the gene

therapy on the Mass model so I see no

behavioral effect and no gene expression

or that I make um the model more severe

more thck um do you have

any I mean looking broadly for something

that's gone wrong is it's a very broad

approach do you have any specifics that

you predict Maybe happen so if the if

the vector makes the animals worse they

may die for example so decrease survival

poor weight gain um a change in their

motor Behavior to make them more

severe okay and one more question if you

so so in doing this you've actually got

quite a nice experimental model and your

application at the minute is written

very much as a process towards sort of

clinical translation so is there

anything mechanistically that you would

like to study in this given that you

have a knockout environment and then

you're actually replacing back

functional protein hopefully um so

there's an opportunity to look at the

progressive and neurogenerative features

of this Mass model so what would you do

um so we would look at the

histopathology um in particular so look

at um neuronal generation in the

substantial nigress trial regions and

really look at what happens um with

dopamine transporter expression in for

example the wrong cell type and how that

may influence um neuro degeneration for

example so there's hypotheses that

abnormal dopamine uptake leads to um

neuronal

generation thank you so final question

from Professor V so thank you for this

excellent project I really wanted to ask

you a question around

timing and so do you do you have a sense

of whether the gene therapy needs to be

given at a certain time during uh the

lifetime of an animal to get best effect

do you have some sense of that so we've

um chosen as early as possible so P0 on

the date of on the day of birth to

really um maximize the chances of um

effect with Gen therapy

um but in and there and that's why we've

planned the different time points of

delivery to see if that affects how well

the gene therapy works um but but do you

have a sense in your cohort of

children at what stage in the disease

process you're getting irreversible

damage uh I think that's why the natural

history study in the patients would be

vital really um so it is a disease

Spectrum at the moment so what we may

see is the most severe patients um if

you give that early may change into the

disease Spectrum where they get a a

childhood parkinsonism instead rather

than restoring back entirely to normal

so really the natural history study for

this disease really needs to be done to

better understand this and that's

happening in par is it yeah so we've

asked you lots of questions is there

anything you want to ask us uh no thank

you for your attention well thank you

very much for coming thank

you
